.2 Running the regression tests ..

The easiest way to run the regression tests for Mono is to download the .tar.gz ._
distribution of db4o.  After untarring the tarball, simply change into the ._
created directory and run "make".

The Makefile will automatically compile db4o and run the test suite.
