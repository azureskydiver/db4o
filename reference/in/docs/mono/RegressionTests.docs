.2 The built-in db4o regression tests ..

Db4o includes a fairly comprehensive suite of regression tests to help prevent ._
errors from creeping into the code over time.  Since no regression test suite ._
is perfect, we are documenting how to work with our tests in the hope that ._
customers will benefit from seeing the test suite improve.

.2 Running the regression tests ..

The easiest way to run the regression tests for Mono is to download the .tar.gz ._
distribution of db4o.  After untarring the tarball, simply change into the ._
created directory and run "make".

The Makefile will automatically compile db4o and run the test suite.


.2 Switching individual tests on or off ..

Individual tests may be turned on or off by commenting or uncommenting ._
lines corresponding to each individual test in the suite.  The test suite ._
is defined by classes beginning with com.db4o.test.AllTestsConf*.  Each ._
test class is listed in an array returned by the tests() method in the ._
*Conf* class.
