        <h1>Hardware Resources</h1><p><br></p><p>Initial object storing requires little calculation, but can
be resource consuming on disk access. Therefore the main hardware resource that
will affect db4o insert performance is the hard drive. The faster is the hard
drive the better performance you will get. </p>

<p>An alternative to a hard drive database storage can be a
database file stored in RAM. This can be done by placing the database file in a
designated RAM-drive or by using db4o memory io-adapter:</p>







<p>The following test can be performed to compare performance
of a hard drive and a RAM drive:</p>







<p>The RAM driver was downloaded <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/05/27/free-ramdisk-for-windows-vista-xp-2000-and-2003-server/">here</a>
and installed on R:\ drive.</p>

<p>The following results were achieved for the
