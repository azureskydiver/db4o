<p>You can use the following test to compare the performance on
your network:</p>





<p>With a good and reliable network you can use the same
methods to improve the insert performance as in a local mode. However, if your
network connection is not always perfect you will need to use commits more
often to ensure that the objects do not get lost. See the
<a href="commit_frequency.htm" class="wikiLink">next chapter</a> for recommendations on commit performance.</p></div>
