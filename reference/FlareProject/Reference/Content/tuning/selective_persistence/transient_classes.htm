        <h1>Transient Classes</h1><p>Some of the classes are not supposed to be persistent. Of
course you can avoid saving their instances in your code and mark all their
occurrences in another classes as transient (<a href="transient_fields_in_java.htm" class="wikiLink">Java</a>/<a href="transient_fields_in_.net.htm" class="wikiLink">.NET</a>). But that needs some attention
and additional coding. You can achieve the same result in an easier way using
TransientClass interface:</p>




<p>TransientClass is a marker interface, which guarantees that
the classes implementing it will never be added to the class metadata. In fact
they are just skipped silently by db4o persistence mechanism.</p>

<p>An example of the TransientClass implementation is db4o
object container (we do not need to save a database into itself).</p>

<p>Let's look how it works on an example. We will create a
simplest class implementing TransientClass interface:</p>





<p>NotStorable class will be used as a field in two test
objects: <a href="transient_classes/test1.htm" class="wikiLink">Test1</a> and <a href="transient_classes/test2.htm" class="wikiLink">Test2</a>.</p>

<p>In our example we will use the default configuration and
save Test1 and Test2 objects just as usual:</p>




<p>Now let's try to retrieve the saved objects:</p>




If you will run the example code you will see
that all the instances of NotStorable class are set to null.
