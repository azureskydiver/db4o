        <h1>Native Query Concepts</h1>
<p>Database query is a language used to communicate with the
database. For a long time databases stood the central and commanding place in
software products: the applications were literally written to support the needs
of a main central database. However, in the modern high-speed world of
distribute computing the transfer and modification of the information plays
increasingly important role and the databases more and more often take a place
of a temporary storage or a point of exchange. </p>

<p>This evolutionary change results in some practical
modifications: more attention is paid to the business logic and tools that are
used for its development, language structures are automatically produced and
checked by development environments and string-based logic is getting outdated
and not enough efficient. Database query language is expected to follow the
features of an object-oriented language: type-safe, easy to refactor and test.
String-based languages like SQL, OQL, JDOQL do not meet these requirements. To
fill this gap and provide developers with sufficient database query tools a new
concept was developed by W.Cook and C. Rosenberger which was given a name <a href="http://www.odbms.org/download/010.01 Cook Native Queries for Persistent Objects August 2005.pdf">Native
Queries</a>. </p>

<p>In the following paragraphs, we will review the concepts of
Native Queries (NQ). We will use Pilot class for all examples suggested
further:</p>
