        <h1>Pluggable IO Concept</h1>


<p>Db4o input/output implementation comes as a pluggable module. It means that you can write your own IO system based on IoAdapter class.</p>

<p>Pluggable IO Adapter has control over the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>place and method of storing a database file;</li>

<li>the form of the stored file (plain, encrypted);</li>

<li>additional actions that are taken at read,write,close,open events.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of the popular implementations of IoAdapter:</p>

<ul>
<li>encryption IoAdapter: database stream is encrypted-decrypted upon read-write operations;</li>

<li>native IoAdapter: uses native system API for file access (WinAPI for example);</li>

<li>memory IoAdapter: keeps database in RAM instead of hard drive;</li>

<li>IoAdapter using several physical locations to store a database;</li>

<li>debug IoAdapter: outputs various debugging information to the specified output stream.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can look at the db4o source to see some of these implementations (search for classes inheriting from IoAdapter).</p>

<p>By default db4o uses RandomAccessFileAdapter. You can install another IoAdapter with a single call:</p>







<p>Please, note: this call should be issued before opening of a database file. IoAdapter can be changed only while the database is closed.</p>

<p>For a test, let's try to create debugging IoAdapter, which will log all the information about its actions to the output stream:</p>







<p>Now let's test how it works:</p>





<p> </p>

<p>The output can be used for debugging purposes.
