<p>NonFlushingIoAdapter is a special IO Adapter, which can be used to improve commit performance. Commit is a complex operation and requires <a href="../../basic_concepts/acid_model/acid_properties_for_db4o.htm" class="wikiLink">flushing to the hard drive</a> after each stage of commit. This is necessary as most operating system try to avoid the overhead of disk access by
caching disk write data and only flushing the resulting changes to the
disk. In the case of db4o commit it would mean that the physical write of some commit stages will be partially skipped and the data will be irreversibly lost. <br></p><p>However, physical access to the hard drive is a time-consuming operation and may considerably affect the performance.&nbsp; That is where NonFlushingIoAdapter comes in: it allows the operating system to keep commit data in cache and do the physical writes in a most performant order. This may sound very nice, but in fact a system shutdown while the commit data is still in cache will lead to the database corruption.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use the NonFlushingIoAdapter. You can run it and see the performance improvement on commit stage:</p>



<p>Please, remember, that NonFlushingIoAdapter is potentially dangerous and any unexpected system shutdown may corrupt your database. Use with caution and avoid using in production environments.&nbsp;</p>
