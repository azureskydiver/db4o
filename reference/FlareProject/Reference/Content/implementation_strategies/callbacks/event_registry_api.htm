        <h1>Event Registry API</h1>



<p>External callbacks should be registered with db4o
EventRegistry. Follow the steps below to start using your own event handlers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain an
     instance of EventRegistry object for your ObjectContainer
</p>





</li>

<li>Register the required event. For "created" event the code is the following:







</li>

<li>Create your own event handler:







<p>The action raised the event can be cancelled in Creating,
Activating, Deactivating, Updating and Deleting event handlers. These events accept CancellableObjectEventArgs as a parameter. In order to cancel the action use:</p>







<p>Here <code>cancellableEventArgs</code> is an event argument of <code>CancellableObjectEventArgs</code> type.</p>


</li>

<li>After the work is done you can unregister the events:






</li>
</ol>

<p>EventRegistry features:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can register several event handlers for a single
event. </li>

<li>You can get different EventRegistry's for different
ObjectContainer instances using EventRegistryFactory. </li>

<li>In Java, callbacks are implemented as Listeners, .NET
uses Native events </li>

<li>Callbacks only work run in
local mode or on the server side in client/server mode. </li>

<li>Each event applies to all the objects or
queries(QueryStarted/QueryFinished events ). In order to distinguish the
specific case, to which the handler should be applied, use the event arguments.
</li>
</ul>


<p>For example:</p>
