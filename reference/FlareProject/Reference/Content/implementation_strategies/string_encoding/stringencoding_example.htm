        <h1>StringEncoding Example</h1><p>Lets look
at an example string encoding implementation. We need to provide 2 methods:
encode, which takes a string and produces byte array and decode, taking a byte
array and producing a string. To make it interesting, we will "encrypt" the
bytes stored in the database, by shifting them 1 byte ahead with the following
class:</p>







<p>The
following code creates a StringEncoding class and adds it to configuration:</p>







<p>You can
see that any string code can be easily integrated into the encoding procedure.</p>

<p>In order
to test that the code works it is actually enough to just open the database 2
times: as it was mentioned before, internal db4o metadata is stored as strings
and therefore opening the database second time will fail if the StringEncoding
is not correct.</p>
