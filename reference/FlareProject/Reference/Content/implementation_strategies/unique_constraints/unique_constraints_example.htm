        <h1>Unique Constraints Example</h1>

<p>Let's look at a simple example with 2 clients adding objects
of the same class to the database. First of all, let's create an appropriate
configuration:</p>







<p>Configuration returned by <code>configure</code> method will
be passed to the server.</p>







Running this example you will get an exception trying
to commit <code>client1</code> as the changes made by client2 containing a <code>Pilot</code>
object with the same name are already committed to the database.
