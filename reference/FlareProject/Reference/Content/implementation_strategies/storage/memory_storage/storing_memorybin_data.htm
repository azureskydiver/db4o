        <h1>Storing MemoryBin Data</h1>
<p>In the <a href="simple_example.htm" class="wikiLink">previous
example</a> we've learned how to use a MemoryStorage to create a database and run
queries in it. However, in most of the cases you will still need a backup of
the data in memory earlier or later. To get it, you will need to close the
object container and store the contents of the MemoryBin to a normal file. </p>



<p>Note, that the result
file can be used as a normal db4o database.</p></div>
