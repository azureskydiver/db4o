        <h1>Inserting Class Into A Hierarchy</h1>

<p>We will use the same <a href="a.htm" class="wikiLink">A</a>, <a href="b.htm" class="wikiLink">B</a> and <a href="c.htm" class="wikiLink">C</a> classes
as in the <a href="removing_class_from_a_hierarchy.htm" class="wikiLink">previous example</p>

<p></a>. The goal is to insert a new class with additional members
between B and C class in the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Let's store some class objects first:</p>







<p>The following class will be inserted:</p>







<p>Now C class must inherit from D. We can't change C class
itself, because its data will be lost. Therefore we will create a new E class
to hold C data:</p>







<p>When all the necessary classes are created we can copy C
data into E class:</p>







<p>Now C classes can be safely removed from the project and all
the references to it updated to E(or D). We can check that all the values are
in place:</p>







<p>When performing refactoring on your working application do
not forget to make a copy of the code and data before making any changes!</p></div>
