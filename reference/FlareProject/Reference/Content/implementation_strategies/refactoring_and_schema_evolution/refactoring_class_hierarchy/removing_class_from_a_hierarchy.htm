        <h1>Removing Class From A Hierarchy</h1><p><br></p><p>Let's use <a href="a.htm" class="wikiLink">A</a>,<a href="b.htm" class="wikiLink">B</a> and <a href="c.htm" class="wikiLink">C</a> classes and remove B class,
copying its values to the updated C class. </p>

<p>First of all let's store some class objects to the database:</p>







<p>If we will remove B class and update C class to inherit from
A, we won't be able to read C data from the database anymore (exception).&nbsp; In order to preserve C data we will need to
transfer it to another class:</p>







<p>We can also transfer B data into this class.</p>

<p>Once D class is created we can run the data transfer:</p>







<p>Now B and C classes can be safely removed from the project
and all the references to them updated to D. We can check that all the values
are in place:</p>







<p>When performing refactoring on your working application do
not forget to make a copy of the code and data before making any changes!</p></div>
