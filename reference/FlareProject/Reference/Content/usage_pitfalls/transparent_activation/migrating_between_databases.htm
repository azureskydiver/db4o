<p>Transparent activation and persistence functionality depends
on an association between an object and an object container, which is created
when an activator is bound to the object. Each object allows only one
activator. Typically this limitation won't show up, however there is a valid
use case for it: </p>

<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suppose
you need to copy one or more objects from one object container to another;</p>

<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you
will retrieve the object(s) from the first object container using any suitable
query syntax;</p>

<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; optionally
you can close the first object container;</p>

<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you
will now save the object to the second object container.</p>

<p>If both object containers were
using transparent activation or persistence - the 4-th step will throw an
exception. Let's look at the case in more detail. Typical activatable class
contains an <code>activator</code> field. When transparent activation
functionality is used for the first time an object container activator will be
bound to the object:</p>







<p>If <code>bind</code> method will
be re-called with the same object container, activator parameter will always be
the same. However, if another object container tries to bind the object (in our
case with the <code>store</code> call) activator parameter will be different,
which will cause an exception. (Exception will be thrown even if the first
object container is already closed, as activator object still exists in the
memory.) This behaviour is illustrated with the following example
(<a href="../../object_lifecycle/activation/transparent_activation_framework/detailed_example.htm" class="wikiLink">SensorPanelTA</a> class from Transparent Activation chapter is used):</p>







<p>The solution to this problem is
simple: activator should be unbound from the object:</p>







<p>Note, that the object will quit
being activatable for the first object container. The following example shows
the described behaviour:</p>
