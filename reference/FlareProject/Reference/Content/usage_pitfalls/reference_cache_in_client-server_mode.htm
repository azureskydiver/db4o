        <h1>Reference Cache In Client-Server Mode</h1>Db4o uses object <a href="../basic_concepts/object_identity/weak_references.htm" class="wikiLink">reference
cache</a> for easy access to persistent objects during one transaction. In
client/server mode each client has its own reference cache, which helps to
achieve good performance. However it gets complicated, when different clients
work on the same object, as this object's cached value is used on each side. It
means, that even when the operations go serially, the object's value won't be
updated serially unless it is refreshed before each update.

<p>The following example demonstrates this behaviour.</p>







<p>In order to make the objects consistent on each client you
must refresh them from the server when they get updated. This can be done by
using <a href="../implementation_strategies/callbacks/commit-time_callbacks/committed_event_example.htm" class="wikiLink">Committed
Callbacks</a>.</p></div>
