        <h1>Optimistic Locking</h1><p>In optimistic locking system no locks are used to prevent
collision: any user can read an object into the memory and work on it at any
time. However, before the client can save its modifications back to the database,
a check should take place verifying that the item did not change since the time
of initial read (no collision occurred). If a collision is detected it should
be resolved according to your application logic. Typical solutions are:</p>

<ul><li>Rollback
</li><li>Display the
problem and let the user decide<br> </li><li>Merge the
changes </li><li>Log the
problem so someone can decide later </li><li>Ignore the
collision and overwrite</li></ul>









<p>Let's look at an example realization.</p>

<p>We will use a db4o database containing
objects of Pilot class and a separate thread to create a client connection to
the database, retrieve and modify objects.</p>



<p>A semaphore is used for locking the object
before saving and the lock is released after commit when the changes become
visible to the other clients. The semaphore is assigned a name based on object
ID to make sure that only the modified object will be locked and the other
clients can work with the other objects of the same class simultaneously.</p>

<p>Locking the object for the update only
ensures that no changes will be made to the object from the other clients
during update. However the object might be already changed since the time when
the current thread retrieved it. In order to check this we will need to
implement an event handler for the updating event:</p>

<p>In the above case the changes are discarded
and a message is sent to the user if the object is already modified from
another thread. You can replace it with your own strategy of collision
handling.</p>

<p>Note: the supplied example has random delays
to make the collision happen. You can experiment with the delay values to see
different behavior.</p>
