        <h1>Pessimistic Locking</h1><p>Pessimistic locking is an approach when an entity is locked in the
database for the entire time that it is in application memory. This means that
an object should be locked as soon as it is retrieved from the database and
released after commit.</p>




<p>As you see this approach is considerably easier to implement.
Another advantage is that it guarantees that your changes to the database are
made consistently and safely.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage is the lack of scalability. Time
waiting for the lock to be released can become unacceptable for a system with
many users or long transactions. This limits the practical implementations of
pessimistic locking.</p>

<p>You may want to select pessimistic locking
in cases when the cost of loosing the transaction results due to a collision is
too high.</p>
