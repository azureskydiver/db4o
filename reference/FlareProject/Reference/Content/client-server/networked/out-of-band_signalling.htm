        <h1>Out-of-band Signalling</h1>
<p>Sometimes a client needs to send a special message
to a server in order to tell the server to do something. The server
may need to be signalled to perform a defragment or it may need to be
signalled to shut itself down gracefully.</p>
<p>This is configured by calling setMessageRecipient(), passing the object that will process client-initiated messages.</p>
