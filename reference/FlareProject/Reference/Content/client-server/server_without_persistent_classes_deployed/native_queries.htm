        <h1>Native Queries</h1>

<p>We have checked in the SODA topic that SODA queries
can work with a server without application classes deployed. So we can expect
optimized Native Queries (converted to SODA under the hood) to work as well:<br>
</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if
the query cannot be optimized to SODA, the server needs to instantiate the
classes to run the query. This is not possible if the class is not available</p>

<p>This
query won't work:</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>

</p><p>If you want to use unoptimized Native Queries in a client-server environment, you must make sure, that the Native Query classes are deployed on the server side. You can do so by implementing all predicate classes in a separate library and deploying it on both the client and the server side.
