        <h1>Using Messaging API For Remote Code Execution</h1>

<p>Messaging API gives you an easy and powerful tool for remote code execution. The short overview of the API is in <a href="../messaging.htm" class="wikiLink">Messaging chapter</a>. </p>
<p>All you will need to do is to define specific message class or classes (should be shared between client and server).</p>
<p>The client side can issue messages using:</p>







<p>The server side should register a message listener:</p>






Message recipient should define a response to the different messages received in





<p>method. ObjectContainer parameter gives full control over the database.</p>
<p>Let's reset our database and try updating using special UpdateServer message.</p>




You can also put some information in the message being sent (UpdateServer class).
<p>The advantage of this method is that having predefined message types you can make any changes to the handling code only on the server side. In the situations with many distributed clients it can really save you lots of time on support.</p></div>
