        <h1>Simple Example</h1>
<p>The following example does a simple replication from a
handheld database to the desktop database:</p>






We start by opening two ObjectContainers. The next line
creates the ReplicationSession. This object&nbsp;contains all of the
replication-related logic.

<p>After creating the session, there is an interesting line:</p>






This line of code will get the provider associated with the
first of our sources (the handheld&nbsp;ObjectContainer in this case). Then it
finds all of the objects that have been updated or created.&nbsp;The
new/modified objects will be returned in an enumerable ObjectSet.<br>
<p>
After that comes a simple loop where the resulting objects are replicated one
at a time.<br>
The <code>replication.commit()</code> call at the end is important. This line
will save all of the changes we have made, and end any needed transactions.
Forgetting to make this call will result in&nbsp;your replication changes being
discarded when your application ends, or your ObjectContainers are&nbsp;closed.<br>
The <code>#commit()</code> calls also mark all objects as replicated.
Therefore, changed/new objects that are not&nbsp;replicated in this session
will be marked as replicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
