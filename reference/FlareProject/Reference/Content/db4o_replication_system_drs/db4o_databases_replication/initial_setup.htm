        <h1>Initial Setup</h1><p>When replicating objects to and from a db4o database, we
need to enable UUIDs and VersionNumbers. </p>

<p>UUIDs are object IDs that are unique across all databases
created with&nbsp;db4o. That is achieved by having the database creation
timestamp as part&nbsp;of its objects UUIDs. The db4o UUID contains two parts.
The first part contains an object ID. The second part identifies
the&nbsp;database that originally created this ID.&nbsp; More information on the UUIDs can be found in the <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/Resources/view.aspx/Reference/Implementation_Strategies/IDs_And_UUIDs/Unique_Universal_IDs">db4o
reference documentation</a>.<br>
The replication system will use the version number to invisibly tell when an
object was last replicated,&nbsp;and if any changes have been made to the
object since it was last replicated. An object's version number&nbsp;indicates
the last time an object was modified. It is the database version at the moment
of the modification. </p>







<p>The above settings can also be applied to a specific class
object, which needs to be replicated. This can help to improve the performance
if only selected classes need to be replicated:</p>
