        <h1>Bi-Directional Replication</h1><p><br></p><p>The previous example copied all
new or modified objects from the handheld device to the desktop&nbsp;database.
What if we want to go the other way? Well, we only have to add one more loop:</p>





Now our handheld contains all
of the new and modified records from our desktop.<br><p>
Easy, isn't it? Now, if there had been any modifications made to the
destination database,&nbsp;the two are now both in sync with each other. </p>
