        <h1>Insert And Remove</h1>
<p>When an object is inserted or removed from the list, only
the list object needs to be updated, the objects in the list are not going to
be changed. That means that for the object from the <a href="../collections_update_depth.htm" class="wikiLink">previous topic</a> we will need to set update depth = 1.</p>

<p>Let's fill up the database with 2 long lists of objects:</p>





<p>We will remove an object from one list and insert it into
another:</p>





<p>Remember, if an object is removed from the list and is not
going to be used any more, it should be deleted manually:</p>

<p><code>db.Delete(dataObject)</code></p>


<p>Let's check if the results are correct:</p>






<p>You will see that insert/remove operation takes much less time with the correct update depth setting. </p></div>
