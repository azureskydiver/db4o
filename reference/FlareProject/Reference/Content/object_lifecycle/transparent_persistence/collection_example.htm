<p>In the <a href="detailed_example.htm" class="wikiLink">previous example</a> we reviewed how Transparent Persistence should be used with simple types. Let's now look how it is done with the collections.</p>
<p>In order to make collections TP Activatable you will need to use db4o-specific ArrayList4 collection. This collection implements .NET/Java collection interfaces, therefore it can be easily integrated with your code. The following class contains a collection of Pilot objects:</p>



<p>You can see that except for using ArrayList4, the implementation follows the same rules as in the previous <a href="detailed_example.htm" class="wikiLink">simple example</a>.</p>
<p>Its usage has no surprises as well:</p>






<p>So the only thing you should remember when using TP with collections is to use ArrayList4 instead of platform-specific collection.<br></p>
