<p>As we have already seen, we call delete() on objects to get rid of them.</p>







<p>Fine, the car is gone. What about the pilots?</p>








<p>Ok, this is no real surprise - we don't expect a pilot to vanish when his&nbsp;car is 
disposed of in real life, too. But what if we want an object's children&nbsp;to be 
thrown away on deletion, too?</p>
<a name="Recursive Deletion&nbsp;"></a><h2>Recursive Deletion&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The problem of recursive deletion (and its 
solution, too) is quite similar to the <a href="updating_structured_objects.htm" class="wikiLink">update</a> problem. Let's configure db4o to delete a car's pilot, too, when the car is deleted.</p>














<p>Again: Note that all configuration must take place before the ObjectContainer is 
opened.</p>
<p>Another way to organize cascaded deletion is using <a href="../../implementation_strategies/callbacks/possible_usecases/cascaded_behavior.htm" class="wikiLink">callbacks</a>. The callbacks allow you to specify explicitly, which objects are to be deleted.<br></p>
<a name="Recursive Deletion Revisited"></a><h2>Recursive Deletion Revisited</h2>
<p>But wait - what happens if the children of a removed object are still referenced 
by&nbsp;other objects?</p>













<p>Currently db4o does <b>not</b> check whether objects to be deleted are 
referenced anywhere&nbsp;else, so please be very careful when using this 
feature.However it is fairly easy to implement referential checking on 
deletion using deleting() callback. See <a href="../../implementation_strategies/callbacks.htm" class="wikiLink">Callbacks chapter</a> for more 
information.</p></div>
