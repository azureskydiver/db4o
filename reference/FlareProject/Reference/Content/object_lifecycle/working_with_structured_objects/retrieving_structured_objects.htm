<p>To retrieve all cars a simple 'blank' prototype can be used.</p>



<p>Now let's initialize the prototype to specify all cars driven by Rubens 
Barrichello.</p>


<p>What about retrieving a pilot by car? You simply don't need that -if you 
already know the car, you can simply access the pilot field directly.</p>



<a name="Native Queries"></a><h2>Native Queries</h2>
<p>Using native queries with constraints on deep structured objects is 
straightforward, you can do it just like you would in plain other code. 
<br><br>Let's constrain our query to only those cars driven by a Pilot with a 
specific name:</p>



<a name="SODA Query API"></a><h2>SODA Query API </h2>
<p>In order to use SODA for querying for a car given its pilot's name you have to 
descend two levels into our query.</p>




<p>You can also constrain the pilot field with a prototype to achieve the same 
result.</p>




<p>Descending into a query provides you with another query. Starting out from a 
query root you can descend in multiple directions. In practice this is the same 
as ascending from one child to a parent and descending to another child. The 
queries turn one-directional references in objects into true relations. Here is 
an example that queries for "a Pilot that is being referenced by a Car, where 
the Car model is 'Ferrari'":</p>
