        <h1>Query By Example</h1>
<p>When using <i>Query By Example</i>(QBE) you provide db4o with a template 
object. db4o will return all of the objects which match all non-default field 
values. This is done via reflecting all of the fields and building a query 
expression where all non-default-value fields are combined with AND expressions. 
Here's a simple example:</p>



<p>Querying 
this way has some obvious limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>db4o must reflect all members of 
your example object.</li>
<li>You cannot perform advanced query expressions. (AND, 
OR, NOT, etc.)</li>
<li>You cannot constrain on values like 0 (integers), "" (empty 
strings), or nulls (reference types) because they would be interpreted as 
unconstrained.</li>
<li>You need to be able to create <a href="query_by_example/qbe_limitations.htm" class="wikiLink">objects without initialized 
fields</a>. That means you can not initialize fields where they are declared. <br></li>
<li>You need a <a href="query_by_example/qbe_limitations.htm" class="wikiLink">constructor</a> to create objects 
without initialized fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see <a href="query_by_example/qbe_limitations.htm" class="wikiLink">QBE Limitations</a>. To get around all of these constraints, db4o 
provides the <a href="native_queries.htm" class="wikiLink">Native Query</a> (NQ) system.</p></div>
