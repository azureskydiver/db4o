        <h1>QBE Limitations</h1><p>As it was mentioned <a href="../query_by_example.htm" class="wikiLink">before</a> QBE has some serious limitations. 
</p><p>Query-By-Example evaluates all non-null
fields and all simple type variables that do not hold their default
values against the stored objects. Check to make sure that you are
not constraining the resultset by accidentally initializing variables
on your template objects. Typical places could be: <br></p><ul><li>Constructors
</li><li>Constructors in ancestors of your class </li><li>Static
initialization </li><li>Static initialization in ancestors of your
class.</li></ul><p>The following classes provide an example of classes that cannot be used with QBE:</p><ul><li><a href="qbe_limitations/pilot1.htm" class="wikiLink">Pilot1</a></li><li><a href="qbe_limitations/pilot1derived.htm" class="wikiLink">Pilot1Derived</a> <br></li><li><a href="qbe_limitations/pilot2.htm" class="wikiLink">Pilot2</a></li><li><a href="qbe_limitations/pilot2derived.htm" class="wikiLink">Pilot2Derived</a> <br></li></ul><p>The following examples show the results of QBE usage with the classes above. Note, that there are some differences between Java and .NET behavior: </p><ul><li>in Java QBE does not return any results when static initialization or initialization in a constructor is present;</li><li>in .NET QBE will return results in the above-mentioned cases, but it can't guarantee that the result will be correct if the value was changed in the constructor.<br></li></ul><p>1. QBE used against a class that has arbitrary member initialization in the constructor:&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. This example is similar to the previous one, but uses a class derived from the class in test1:</p>






<p>3. This example uses QBE against a class with static member initialization:</p>



<p>4. This example is similar to test3, but a derived class is used:</p>
