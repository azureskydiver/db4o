<p>This is the default query mode:
the whole query result is evaluated upon query execution and object IDs list is
produced as a result. </p>








<p>Obviously object evaluation
takes some time and in a case of big resultsets you will have to wait for a long
time before the first result will be returned. This is especially unpleasant in
a client-server setup, when query processing can block the server for seconds or even minutes.</p>

<p>This mode makes the whole
objects result set available at once - ID list is built based on the committed
state in the database. As soon as a result is delivered it won't be changed
neither by changes in current transaction neither by committed changes from
another transactions. </p>

<p>Note, that resultset contains
only references to objects, you were querying for, which means that if an
object field has changed by the time of the actual object retrieval from the
object set - you will get the new field value:</p>







<a name="Immediate Mode Pros And Cons"></a><h2>Immediate Mode Pros And Cons</h2>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the query is intended to iterate through the entire resulting ObjectSet, this mode will be slightly faster than the
others.</li>

<li>The query will process without intermediate
side effects from changed objects (by the caller or by other transactions).</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Query processing can block the server for a long time.</li>

<li>In comparison to the other modes it will take longest until the first
results are returned.</li>

<li>The ObjectSet will require a considerate amount of memory to hold the
IDs of all found objects.</li>
