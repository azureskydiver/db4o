        <h1>Deleting Collections</h1><p>As it was discussed in
<a href="../working_with_structured_objects/deleting_structured_objects.htm" class="wikiLink">Deleting Structured Objects</a> chapter,
deleting a top-level object does not mean deleting all of the member objects.
The same rule applies for collections. The recommendation would be to use
cascadeOnDelete setting for a collection, which should be deleted with all its
members.</p><p>For the following example we will use <a href="example_classes.htm" class="wikiLink">DataObject and
ListObject</a> classes. The database will be filled up with the
<a href="filling_the_database.htm" class="wikiLink">FillUpDb</a> method. <br></p>




Please, remember that there is no referential
integrity check on delete: deleted objects might be referenced from elsewhere
in your code.
