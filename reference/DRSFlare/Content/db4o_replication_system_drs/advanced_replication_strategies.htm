        <h1>Advanced Replication Strategies</h1>
        <p>This topic deals with more complex replication scenarios:</p>
        <p>dRS supports events, which you can use to integrate additional logic into the replication. <MadCap:xref href="advanced_replication_strategies/events.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Events"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Sometimes changes on different databases result in a conflict. Then you need to take care it. <MadCap:xref href="advanced_replication_strategies/dealing_with_conflicts.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Dealing with Conflicts"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Maybe you have an existing database which you want to replicate. <MadCap:xref href="advanced_replication_strategies/Prepare_old_databases_for_replication.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Prepare Old Databases for Replication"</MadCap:xref></p>
