        <p>The db4o to db4o replication allows you the keep multiple, independent db4o -databases in sync. A typical scenario is when a mobile device is synchronized periodically with the central server or a desktop application</p>
        <p>dRS supports simple unidirectional replication where changes are replicated in one direction. <MadCap:xref href="db4o_databases_replication/simple_example.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Simple Example"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>In addition dRS support bidirectional replication, where changes are replicated in both directions. <MadCap:xref href="db4o_databases_replication/bi-directional_replication.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Bidirectional Replication"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>To avoid replicating the whole database, dRS support also partial replication, where only a subset of all objects are replicated. <MadCap:xref href="db4o_databases_replication/selective_replication.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Selective Replication"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Furthermore dRS can also replicate deletions of objects. <MadCap:xref href="db4o_databases_replication/deleted_objects_replication.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Replicate Deletions"</MadCap:xref></p>
