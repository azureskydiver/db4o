        <h1>Limitations</h1>
        <h2>Collections Limitation</h2>
        <p>Collections are treated differently by Hibernate and db4o. In db4o a collection is a regular object. In Hibernate collections are representation of join-operations. This means that collections in Hibernate don't have a identity. That why dRS currently doesn't not track updates on collections when replicating against Hibernate. You only can replicate a collection initially, but cannot replicate updates.</p>
