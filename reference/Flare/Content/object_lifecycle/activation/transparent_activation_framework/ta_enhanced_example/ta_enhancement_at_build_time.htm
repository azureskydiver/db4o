                <h1>TA Enhancement At Build Time</h1>
                <p><font color="#990000">&#160;</font>
                </p>
                <p>In the <a href="ta_enhancement_at_load_time.htm"  >previous topic</a> we discussed
how TA can be enabled on classes while they are loaded. In this topic we will
look at even more convenient and performant way of enhancing classes to support
TA: during application build time. </p>
                <p>For our example we will take the same classes as in the
<a href="ta_enhancement_at_load_time.htm"  >previous example</a>, with the exception
of TAInstrumentationRunner class, which won't be needed for build-time
enhancement. Basically, we will move all the enhancing functionality of
TAInstrumentationRunner into the build script. For this example we will create
an ant script, which should be run after the classes (or jar) is built.  </p>
                <p>For simplistic example our build script should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use classes, created by
     normal build script</li>
                    <li>Create a new enhanced-bin
     folder for the enhanced classes</li>
                    <li>Use TAAntClassEditFactory
     to create InjectTransparentActivationEdit (can be based on class filter)</li>
                    <li>Call
     Db4oFileEnhancerAntTask#execute, which will call
     Db4oClassInstrumenter#enhance passing the previously created InjectTransparentActivationEdit
     to instrument classes with TA.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All
these can be done with the following script:</p>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/TA Enhancement At Build Time/Build.Xml/Build.Xml.flsnp" />
                <p>In
order to test this script:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a new project,
     consisting of TAInstrumentationExample and SensorPanel classes from the
     <a href="ta_enhancement_at_load_time.htm"  >previous example</a></li>
                    <li>Add lib folder to the
     project root and copy the following jars from db4o distribution:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ant.jar </li>
                        <li>bloat-1.0.jar</li>
                        <li>db4o-x.x-instrumentation.jar</li>
                        <li>db4o-x.x-java5.jar</li>
                        <li>db4o-x.x-taj.jar</li>
                        <li>db4o-x.x-tools.jar 
      (Note, that the described functionality is only valid for db4o releases
      after 7.0)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Build the project with your
     IDE or any other build tools (it is assumed that the built class files go
     to the project's bin directory)</li>
                    <li>Copy build.xml into the
     root project folder and execute it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Successfully
executed build script will produce an instrumented copy of the project classes
in enhanced-bin folder. You can check the results by running the following
batch file from bin and enhanced-bin folders:</p>
                <p><code>set
CLASSPATH=.;{$PROJECT_ROOT}\lib\db4o-x.x-java5.jar</code>
                </p>
                <p><code>java
com.db4odoc.taexamples.enhancer.TAInstrumentationExample</code>
                </p>
                <p>(In
enhanced version the warning about classes that do not support TA should
disappear).</p>
                <p>Of
course, the presented example is very simple and limited in functionality. In
fact you can do a lot more things using the build script:</p>
                <p>o      
Add NQ optimization in the same enhancer task</p>
                <p>o      
Use ClassFilter to select classes for
enhancement</p>
                <p>o      
Use regex to select classes for enhancement</p>
                <p>o      
Use several source folders</p>
                <p>o      
Use jar as the source for enhancement</p>
                <p>An example of the above features can be found in our <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/ProjectSpaces/view.aspx/TA_And_NQ_Enhancement_Example">Project
Spaces</a>.</p>
