        <h1>Native Queries In Client-Server Mode</h1><p><font color="#990000">This topic applies to java version only</font> </p>
<p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">A quite subtle problem may occur if
you're using Native Queries as anonymous (or just non-static)
inner classes in Client/Server mode. Anonymous/non-static inner class
instances carry a synthetic field referencing their outer class
instance - this is just Java's way of implementing inner class
access to fields or final method locals of the outer class without
introducing any notion of inner classes at all at the bytecode level.
If such a non-static inner class predicate cannot be converted
to S.O.D.A. form on the client, it will be wrapped into an evaluation
and passed to the server, introducing the same problem already
mentioned in the <a href="../object_lifecycle/querying/soda_evaluations.htm" class="wikiLink">evaluation
chapter</a>: db4o will try to transfer the evaluation, using the
standard platform serialization mechanism. If this fails, it will just
try to pass it to the server via db4o marshalling. However, this may
fail, too, for example if the outer class references any local db4o
objects like ObjectContainer, etc., resulting in an
ObjectNotStorableException.</p>
<p>So to be on the safe side with NQs
in C/S mode, you should declare Predicates as top-level or static inner
classes only. Alternatively, you could either make sure that the
outer classes containing Predicate definitions could principally be
persisted to db4o, too, and don't add significant overhead to the
predicate (the appropriate value for 'significant' being your choice) or ensure during development that all predicates used actually can be optimized to S.O.D.A. form.</p>
