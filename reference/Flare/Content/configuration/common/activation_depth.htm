        <h1>Activation Depth</h1>
        <p>db4o uses the concept of <a href="../../object_lifecycle/activation.htm">activation</a> to avoid loading to much data into memory. You can change the global depth.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/configuration/common/CommonConfigurationExamples-Change-activation-depth.all.flsnp" />
        <p>A higher activation depth is usually more convenient to work with, because you don't face inactivated objects. However, a higher activation depth costs performance, because more data has to read from the database. Therefore a good balance need to be found. Take also a look a <a href="../../object_lifecycle/activation/transparent_activation_framework.htm">transparent activation</a>, since it solves the activation issue completely. </p>
        <h2>Class Specific Configuration</h2>
        <p>You can also configure a class specific activation depth. <MadCap:xref href="../objectclass_configuration.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "ObjectClass Configuration"</MadCap:xref></p>
