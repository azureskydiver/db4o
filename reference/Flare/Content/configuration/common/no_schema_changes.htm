        <h1>Disable Schema Change Detection</h1>
        <p>db4o scans the class structure to find out the schema of the objects. This takes a little time. When a lot of classes are persistent this may take some time, especially on embedded devices.</p>
        <p>Therefore you can disable this check. You can disable it only, when db4o already knows all stored classes. This means a object of each class has already been stored once. Furthermore there shouldn't be any further changes.</p>
        <p>This setting is only useful for very special scenarios with no schema evolution at all. Otherwise this setting may cause strange and subtle errors!</p>
