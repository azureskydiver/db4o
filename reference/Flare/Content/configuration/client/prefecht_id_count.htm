        <h1>Prefetching IDs For New Objects</h1>
        <p>Sets the number of IDs to be pre-allocated new objects created on the client. This avoids requests to allocate new ids when new objects are stored on a client.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When a new object is
created on a client, the client should contact the server to get the next
available object ID. PrefetchIDCount allows to specify how many IDs
should be pre-allocated on the server and prefetched by the client. This method
helps to reduce client-server communication.</p>
        <p>PrefetchIDCount can
be tuned to approximately match the usual amount of objects created in one
operation to improve the performance.</p>
        <p>When the PrefetchIDCount is one, the client will have to connect to the server for each new objects created. On the other hand,, when the PrefetchIDCount is
bigger than the amount of new objects  the database will keep
unnecessary preallocated ids. </p>
        <p>The default
PrefetchIDCount is 10.</p>
