        <h1>Max Batch Queue Size</h1>
        <p>To avoid unnecessary network traffic, the client and server can queue up operations, which don't need to be executed immediately. As soon as a message need to be send, all queued messages are send as well. You can configure the maximum of this message queue.</p>
        <p>A larger size allows to queue up more messages and avoid unnecessary network roundtrip's. However queued up messages consume additional memory.</p>
