        <h1>Single Threaded Client</h1>
        <p>You can configure the client to be single-threaded. When you enable this option, the client doesn't use background threads to handle the client-server communication.</p>

        <h2>Advantage</h2>
        <p>On some smaller embedded systems reducing the running threads improves the performance significantly. </p>
        <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
        <p>Since all operations run in a single thread, the operations may take longer. Additionally you cannot receive <a href="../../client-server/messaging.htm">messages</a> and cannot use <a href="../../implementation_strategies/callbacks/event_registry_api.htm">commit-callbacks</a> on a single-threaded client.</p>
