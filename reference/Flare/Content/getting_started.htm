<p>This topic will give you some start information about db4o and will help you to get your environment ready to work with db4o. </p>
<a name="Download Contents"></a><h2>Download Contents</h2>
<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">
<a name=".NET Platform"></a><h3>.NET Platform</h3>
<p>The db4o .NET distribution comes as one MSI installer file,db4o-x.x-net.msi. You can also choose to download db4o-x.x-net.zip archive. In this case you will have to extract the contents to any folder before starting to use db4o.</p>
<p><b>db4o-X.X/doc/reference</b> </p>
<p>contains reference documentation, which you are reading. </p>
<p>In addition to it you will find the following docs in your distribution:</p>
<p><b>db4o-X.X/doc/tutorial/db4o-tutorial.exe</b></p>
<p>This is the interactive "formula-1" tutorial application for .NET. Examples can be run "live" against a db4o database from within the application. It is recommended to take a first quick "drive" with "formula-1" before studying other db4o documents. </p>
<p><b>db4o-X.X/doc/tutorial/db4o-X.X-tutorial.pdf</b></p>
<p>The PDF version of the tutorial allows best fulltext search capabilities.</p>
<p><b>db4o-X.X/doc/api/db4o.chm</b></p>
<p>The API documentation for db4o is supplied as a compiled Help file. While you read through the rest of this documentation, it may be helpful to look into the API documentation occasionaly.</p>

<p>contains reference documentation, which you are reading. </p>
<p>In addition to it you will find the following docs in your distribution:</p>
<p><b>db4o-X.X/doc/tutorial/index.htm</b></p>
<p>This is the interactive "formula-1" HTML tutorial. Examples can be run "live" against a db4o database from within the browser. In order to use the interactive functionality a Java JRE 1.3 or above needs to be installed and integrated into the browser. Java security settings have to allow applets to be run.</p>
<p>It is recommended to take a first quick "drive" with "formula-1" before studying other db4o documents.</p>

<a name="The db4o Engine"></a><h2>The db4o Engine</h2>
<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">
<p>The db4o object database engine for .NET platforms consists of one single DLL. This is all that you need to program against. In addition you may want to use client/server library or optional components. </p>
<p>db4o is available in two separate distributions for Microsoft .NET. One distribution is for the .NET Framework 1.1 and the other is for the .NET Framework 2.0. Be sure to use the correct one for your project environment.</p>
<p><b>/db4o-X.X/bin/net[-2.0]/Db4objects.Db4o.dll</b></p>
<p>is the standard db4o engine for the .NET framework.</p>
<p><b>/db4o-X.X/bin/compact[-2.0]/</b><b>Db4objects.Db4o</b><b>.dll</b></p>
<p>is built for the .NET CompactFramework.</p>
<p><a href="platform_specific_issues/security_requirements_on_.net_platform.htm" class="wikiLink">Security Requirements On .NET Platform</a> discusses, which security permissions should be granted to db4o assembly for correct operation.</p>
<p>Since version 6.0 you will also see legacy libraries in the distribution. These are provided for users, which are not ready yet to upgrade their applications for the new db4o syntax. </p>
</p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:net" />
<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java"><p>The Java version of db4o object database engine consists of one single core jar file. In addition you may want to use client/server library or optional components, which you can add separately or use "db4o-all" jar.  <b>db4o-[version]-core-java1.1.jar</b></p><p>will run with most Java JDKs that supply JDK 1.1.x functionality such as reflection and Exception handling. That includes many IBM J9 configurations, Symbian and Savaje.  <b>db4o-[version]-core-java1.2.jar</b> is built for all Java JDKs between 1.2 and 1.4.  <b>db4o-[version]-core-java5.jar</b> is built for Java JDK 5 and JDK 6  If you intend to use client/server version of db4o you will additionally need client/server library matching your JDK version:  <b>db4o-[version]-cs-java1.1.jar</b> <b>db4o-[version]-cs-java1.2.jar</b> <b>db4o-[version]-cs-java5.jar</b>   Some advanced functionality such as cluster support, platform-specific IO adapters, statistic tools etc can be added by including db4o optional library:  <b>db4o-[version]-optional-java1.1.jar</b> <b>db4o-[version]-optional-java1.2.jar</b> <b>db4o-[version]-optional-java5.jar</b>  You can also get all of the above in a single jar:  <b>db4o-[version]-all-java1.1.jar</b> <b>db4o-[version]-all-java1.2.jar</b> <b>db4o-[version]-all-java5.jar </b> </p><p><a href="platform_specific_issues/security_requirements_on_java_platform.htm" class="wikiLink">Security Requirements On Java Platform</a> reviews db4o jar security permissions requirements.</p>

<a name="Installation "></a><h2>Installation </h2>
<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print">
<a name="Visual Studio Installation"></a><h3>Visual Studio Installation</h3>
<p>To use db4o in a development project, you only need to add one of the above db4o.dll files to your project references.</p>
<p>Here is how to do this with Visual Studio .NET:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy Db4objects.Db4o.dll to your VS.NET project folder</li>
<li>right-click on "References" in the Solution Explorer</li>
<li>choose "Add Reference"</li>
<li>select "Browse"</li>
<li>find the Db4objects.Db4o.dll in your project folder</li>
<li>click "Open"</li>
<li>click "OK"</li>
<li>Right-click db4o</li>
<li>Choose "Properties"</li>
<li>Set "Copy Local" to "True" if it is not already set. </li></ul>
<a name="Mono Installation"></a><h3>Mono Installation</h3>
<p>To use db4o in a development project, you only need to add Db4objects.Db4o.dll file to your project references.</p>
<p>Here is how to do this if you are using MonoDevelop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on "References" in the Solution Tab</li>
<li>choose "Edit References"</li>
<li>select the ".NET Assembly" tab and then "Browse"</li>
<li>select /usr/lib/db4o/Db4objects.Db4o.dll</li>
<li>click "Open"</li>
<li>click "OK" </li></ul>
</p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:net" />
<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">
<a name="Java Installation"></a><h3>Java Installation</h3>
<p>If you add one of the above db4o-*.jar files to your CLASSPATH, db4o is installed. For beginners it is recommended to use "db4o-all" library to avoid confusion with the location of certain classes. In case you work with an integrated development environment like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>  you would copy the db4o-*.jar to a /lib/ folder under your project and add db4o to your project as a library. (You only need to copy the one jar file for the distribution you are targeting.)</p>
<p>Here is how to add the db4o library to an Eclipse project</p>
<ul>
<li>create a folder named "lib" under your project directory, if it doesn't exist yet</li>
<li>copy db4o-*.jar to this folder</li>
<li>Right-click on your project in the Package Explorer and choose "refresh"</li>
<li>Right-click on your project in the Package Explorer again and choose "properties"</li>
<li>select "Java Build Path" in the treeview on the left</li>
<li>select the "Libraries" tabpage.</li>
<li>click "Add Jar"</li>
<li>the "lib" folder should appear below your project</li>
<li>choose db4o-*.jar in this folder</li>
<li>hit OK twice</li><li>expand "Referenced Libraries" branch of your project in Package Explorer.</li><li>select db4o-* library, right-click and open "Properties"</li><li>select Javadoc Location in the list and browse to \doc\api folder in your db4o installation </li></ul>
<p>Please, note, that db4o can't be installed in JDK or JRE lib folder, the reasons are explained <a href="usage_pitfalls/classloader_and_generic_classes.htm" class="wikiLink">further in the documentation</a>.  </p>
