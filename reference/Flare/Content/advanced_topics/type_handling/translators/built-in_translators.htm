        <h1>Built-In Translators</h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal">db4o supplies some build-in translators, which can be used
in general cases. You can use them for your classes if they are not storable or nedd special treatment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>TTransient: Doesn't store the object at all. Usable when you don't want to store instances of certain type. If makes all instances of that type transient.</li>
            <li>TSerializable: Uses the built in serialisation mechanism to store this object.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are other built in translators, which are not intended be used directly. Instead they are used by db4o internally. Nevertheless you can use them as example implementation.
		 Look for all classes which implement the <span MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">I</span>ObjectTranslator-interface</p>
