        <h1>Main Operations Performance</h1><p> </p><p>One of the most important factors in database usage is performance. In the same time it is something difficult to measure and predict
as there are too many factors affecting it. These factors can be dependent or independent of database implementation. Independent factors, such as operating memory, processor speed etc are general for all applications and in many cases are given as initial conditions, which do not allow frequent or tuning at all (for example, embedded mobile devices). On the other hand, dependent factors can usually be changed programmatically and provide valuable effect. </p>

<p>The following articles will give you some average numbers of
db4o performance, providing the testing code that can be easily modified to
accommodate your object model and environment and pointing out the most
influencing performance factors.</p><p> More Reading:<ul>
