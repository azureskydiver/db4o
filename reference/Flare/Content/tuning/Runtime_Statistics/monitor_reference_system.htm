        <h1>Monitor Reference System</h1>
        <p>You can monitor <a href="../../Basic_Concepts/object_identity.htm">the reference-system</a> to find out more about the runtime behavior of your application. The reference-system ensures that each object has only one in memory representation.</p>
        <h2>Configure the Reference System Monitoring Support</h2>
        <p>First you need to add the monitoring support to the db4o configuration.</p>

        <h2>The Freespace Statistics</h2>
        <p><strong MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">ObjectReferenceCount</strong><strong MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">number of object references</strong>: Tells you how many references are currently hold in the reference-system. By default db4o hold uses weak referenced to objects. If this count is very high, you might hold unnecessary references to persisted objects in your application.</p>
