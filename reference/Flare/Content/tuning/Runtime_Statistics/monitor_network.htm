        <p>You can monitor the network-operations of db4o in client-server mode.</p>
        <h2>Configure the Network Monitoring Support</h2>
        <p>First you need to add the monitoring support to the db4o configuration. The network monitoring support is in two separate configuration-items. The NetworkingMonitoringSupport can be used on the server and on a client to monitor the network statistics of the server or client.</p>

        <p> The ClientConnectionsMonitoringSupport can be added to the db4o server to monitor the connected clients.</p>
