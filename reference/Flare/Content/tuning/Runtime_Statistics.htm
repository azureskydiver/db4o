        <h1>Runtime Statistics</h1>
        <p>Db4o Runtime Statistics is a monitoring feature allowing to collect various important runtime db4o data. This data can be crucial in resolving performance issues, analyzing usage patterns, predicting resource bottlenecks etc. Runtime Statistics can be collected both in the application testing stage and in an application deployed to production system.  In the first case this data can help to estimate hardware requirements and analyze the stability of the system. In the latter case, the data can be used to fine-tune performance, find problems and fix bugs.</p>
        <p>Runtime Statistics is a work-in-progress and the new statistics will be added as the need appears. The version <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CurrentVersion" /> includes the following statistics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../object_lifecycle/querying.htm">Queries</a>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>number of class scans / sec
        <p>A class scan means that db4o will need to read each object of a given class in order to figure out whether the object should be included in the result set of a query. In this case indexing the parent referencing field would avoid this costly operation and improve query times.</p></li>
                <li>number of queries / sec
        <p>Number of SODA queries executed per second.</p></li>
                <li>	Average query execution time
        <p>The time to retrieve the list of ids for the matching objects (this doesn't take the time to activate the objects into account)</p></li>
                <li>	number of unoptimized native queries / sec
        <p>Number of native queries (per second) that were not optimized. Developers should strive to run only optimized native queries in order to
        get the best possible performance.</p></li>
                <li>	number of native queries / sec
        <p>Total number of native queries (either optimized or not) executed per second.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li>	<a href="../implementation_strategies/freespace_management_system.htm">FreeSpaceManager</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>	average slot size
        <p>The average size of free storage slots available. Smaller slots are less likely to be reused.</p></li>
                <li>	number of free slots
        <p>A high number of free slots indicates a high level of fragmentation.</p></li>
                <li>	number of reused slots / sec
        <p>Number of reused free slots per second.</p></li>
                <li> number of bytes in free space management
        <p>A high value (with a high value of free slots) is a good indication that defragmenting the database may bring performance improvements.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li>	Reference System</li>
            <ul>
                <li>	number of objects in reference system
        <p>Total number of objects in the db4o reference system.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li>	IO</li>
            <ul>
                <li>	number of bytes read / sec</li>
                <li>	number of  bytes written / sec</li>
                <li>	number of reads / sec</li>
                <li>	number of writes / sec</li>
                <li>	number of syncs / sec</li>
            </ul>
            <li>	<a href="../client-server.htm">Networking</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>	Bytes Sent/Received
        <p>Bytes sent/received from/to clients.</p></li>
                <li>	Connected Clients
        <p>Number of currently connected clients.</p></li>
                <li>	Messages sent
        <p>Number of messages sent from/to db4o clients and servers. Developers can use this statistic as an indicator whenever their object models are driving db4o to exchange too many messages between clients/server. This statistic is also useful to help developers to tweak prefetchDepth/prefetchObjectCount configuration in order to minimize messages exchange between client / servers.</p></li>
            </ul>
