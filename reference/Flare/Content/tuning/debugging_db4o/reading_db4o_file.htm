        <h1>Reading Db4o File</h1><p>For debugging, learning and teaching
purposes, the db4o file format can be modified to be (nearly ?) human readable.</p>

<p>To do this, simply compile the sources
with Deploy.debug set to true, run an application that creates a db4o database
file and look at the file with any editor.</p>

<p>With the Deploy.debug setting all
pointers in the database file will be readable with their physical address as a
readable number.</p>

<p>All other slots will be identifiable by a
single character at the beginning. An index that explains the character
constants can be found in com.db4o.internal.Const4.</p>

<p>To understand the format best, you may
want to look at the <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/ProjectSpaces/view.aspx/Db4o_Product_Design/Db4o_Core/File_Header">File
Header</a> structure and at the #readThis() methods of classes derived from
PersistentBase, like ClassMetadataRepository for instance.</p>

<p>This functionality proved to be very
useful when db4o was originally written. By marking freespace with XXXXes a bug
in the format could be spotted immediately by visual inspection of a database
file.</p><p>To navigate through a database file in
your favourite editor, it will work best if you write a macro for this editor
that allows you to mark and select a number in the database file and to hit a
button in the editor to jump to the corresponding offset in the database file
(number of characters from the beginning).</p>
				<p>Such macro for Microsoft Word is presented below:</p>
				
<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Reading Db4o File/OffsetNavigator.Vb/OffsetNavigator.Vb.flsnp" />
				<p>To make use of it, open Visual Basic Macro editor within your Word environment, create a new Macro in the Normal template and paste the code above. In order to make its usage easy assign a key sequence to call the macro command:</p><ul><li>open Tools/Customize/Commands/Keyboard;</li><li> select
"Macros" as a Category and the newly-created macro name in the Commands list;</li><li> press
a new key sequence for the command and press "Assign".  </li></ul><p>Now you can navigate
through the human-readable db4o file using the selected key sequence.</p>
