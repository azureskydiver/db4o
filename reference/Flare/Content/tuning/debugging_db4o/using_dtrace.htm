        <h1>Using DTrace</h1>
        <p>If you are interested in internal db4o
debugging you can make use of com.db4o.DTrace class. DTrace is basically a
logging agent, which gets called for db4o core events, which can provide
information valuable for debugging. The list of currently available events can
be found in DTrace class, they are represented by DTrace type static variables,
for example:</p>
        <p><code>public
static DTrace ADD_TO_CLASS_INDEX;</code>
        </p>
        <p><code>public
static DTrace BEGIN_TOP_LEVEL_CALL;</code>
        </p>
        <p>DTrace information is not enabled by default, as it
can make the system really slow. In order to enable DTrace make the following changes
in DTrace class and rebuild the core:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>set <code>public static final boolean enabled = true</code></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="unIndentedList">
            <li>modify the <code>configure</code>method to tell DTrace that you are interested in all ranges and IDs </li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>addRangeWithLength(0,Integer.MAX_VALUE);</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>make sure that no <code>turnAllOffExceptFor</code>method is called in the <code>configure()</code> method</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this DTrace setup you will basically
see everything that is happening logged to the console in detail. However, this
information can be excessive and difficult to handle. That is why DTrace
provides different configurations, allowing to limit the range of information
you are interested in.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><code>turnAllOffExceptFor(DTrace[] these)</code>
                <p>This method
allows you to pass an array of DTrace events, which you want to see in the
console. For example:</p>
                <p><code>turnAllOffExceptFor(new DTrace[] { ADD_TO_CLASS_INDEX , BEGIN_TOP_LEVEL_CALL
})</code>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><code>addRange(long)</code>
                <p><code>addRangeWithEnd(long start, long
end) </code>
                </p>
                <p><code>addRangeWithLength(long start, long
length) </code>
                </p>
                <p>These methods allow to specify a range of
addresses in a database file that you are interested in. addRange methods are
especially useful for debugging a database file structure. Note, that in db4o
internal object ID corresponds to the object's address in the file.</p>
            </li>
            <li><code>trackEventsWithoutRange()</code>
                <p>These method will allow all events with no range specified to log
their information.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The format of the output message is the
following:</p>
        <p>: [event number] : [start address] :
[start address] :[information]</p>
        <p><i>event number</i> - sequential event number</p>
        <p><i>start address</i> -start of the event address
range (optional)</p>
        <p><i>end address</i> - end of the event address
range (optional)</p>
        <p><i>information</i>  - informational message from the event</p>
        <p>If DTrace log messages are not enough for you to
track the problem, you can use DTrace in debug mode. Use <code>breakOnEvent(long) </code> method to specify on which address DTrace must break and put a
breakpoint inside <code>breakPoint()</code> method.  As it was mentioned before DTrace events
are already created in the most important execution points of db4o core.
However, if you need more events, feel free to add them, encapsulating the
calls with <code>if (DTrace.enabled)</code> to make sure that your code is
removed from distributions by the compiler.</p>
