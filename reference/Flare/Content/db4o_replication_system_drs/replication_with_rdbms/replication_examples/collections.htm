        <h1>Collections</h1>
					
					<p>This section covers examples on Collection, including array, Set, List and Map. </p>
					<p>As an experienced db4o user, you may know that db4o treats Collection
as first class object, which means it assigns unique UUID to each
Collection. Hence a Collection can be shared among many owners. This is
different to Hibernate's approach, where Collection does not have a
unique ID and they cannot be shared among objects.</p>
					<p>To bridge this gap, dRS treats Collections as second class objects and
does not assign UUIDs to them. When a shared Collection is replicated
from db4o to Hibernate using dRS, it is automatically cloned. Each
owner of the Collection receives a copy of the Collection. Further
modifications to the db4o copy will not be replicated to cloned copies.
Therefore, you cannot share Collections if you want to perform RDBMS
replications with dRS.</p>
	<p>In the following examples, we will use Car as the element in the following examples. </p>
