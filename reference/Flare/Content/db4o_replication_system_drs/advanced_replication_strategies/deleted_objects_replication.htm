        <h1>Deleted Objects Replication</h1>


<p>In addition to replicating changed/new objects, dRS is able to
replicate deletions of objects. When an object is deleted since last
replication in one database and you would like to replicate these
changes to another database you can use the following method to do this:</p>

<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">

<p>Java: </p>

<p><code>replication .replicateDeletions(Car.class);</code></p>

</p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:java" />

<p MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET,Primary.c#">

<p>c#:</p>

<p><code>replication .ReplicateDeletions(typeof(Car));</code></p>

</p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:cs" />

<p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET,Primary.VB.NET"></p>

<p>VB:</p>

<p><code>replication .ReplicateDeletions(GetType(Car))</code></p>

<p></p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:vb" />
</p>

<p>
dRS traverses every Car object in both providers. For instance, if a
deletion is found in one provider, the deletion will be replicated to
the other provider. During the traversal replication events will be
generated and can be used as usual. By default, in a case of a conflict the deletion
will prevail. You can choose the counterpart of the deleted object to
prevail using the event.</p>

<p>Note, that the deletions of a Parent will not be cascaded to child
objects. For example, if a Car contains a child object, e.g. Pilot,
Pilot will not be traversed and the deletions of Pilot will not be
replicated. </p>
