            <MadCap:keyword term="dRS:Concurrency;Replication:Concurrency" />Concurrency-Limitations</h1>
        <p>Currently the dRS has a limitation &#160;considering concurrently replicating and updating a database. Changes which are made during a replication are never replicated. For example a mobile device connects <a href="../../client-server.htm">to a db4o server </a> and replicates the changes. During that process other clients store changes on the server. Now all changes which happen during this replication process are never replicated to the mobile device. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/drs/advanced/AdvancedReplicationExamples-Lost-replication.all.flsnp" />
        <p>The only way to avoid this limitation is to prevent changing the database during a replication.</p>
