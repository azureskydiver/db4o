        <p>It's quite often the case that you need replication in both directions. For example when you have a mobile device which keeps the data in sync with a desktop PC. Changes on the both partners have to be replicated to the other partner.</p>
        <p>First, make sure that you've prepared and configured db4o properly. <MadCap:xref href="simple_example.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Simple Example"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Start a replication-session with the two replication partners. Note that no replication direction is set.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/drs/db4o/Db4oReplicationExamples-Prepare-bidirectional-replication.all.flsnp" />
        <p>Then get the changed objects from both replication partners. Each replication partner returns the updated and created object in a object-set. Then iterate over both object-sets and replicate the changes. </p>
