        <h1>Limitations</h1>
        <h2>Concurrency Limitations</h2>
        <p>The dRS system has currently a lot of restrictions. One major restriction is the concurrency model. While a replication is running you shouldn't change the database. Otherwise updates are lost.
		 <MadCap:xref href="../advanced_replication_strategies/Concurrency.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Concurrency-Limitations".</MadCap:xref> This mean that no other transaction can be running while the replication takes place.</p>
        <h2>Collections Limitation</h2>
        <p>Collections are treated differently by Hibernate and db4o. In db4o a collection is a regular object. In Hibernate collections are representation of join-operations. This means that collections in Hibernate don't have a identity. That why dRS currently doesn't not track updates on collections when replicating against Hibernate. You only can replicate a collection initially, but cannot replicate updates.</p>
