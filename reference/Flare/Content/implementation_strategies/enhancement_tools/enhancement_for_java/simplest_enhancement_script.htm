        <h1>Simplest Enhancement Script</h1>
<p>If you are
not interested in writing complicated ant build scripts for your project, but
still need to use enhancement, we've created a simplest enhance script that can
do the job for any java project with only minor changes or without any changes
at all. Here is the script:</p>

<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Simplest Enhancement Script/Build.Xml/Build.Xml.flsnp" />
<p>In order to
use it - just put it in your project's folder. You will also need to put
db4o-x.x-all-java5.jar (it contains all the required jars) into your lib folder.
If your project uses non-standard Java layout (web application, maven
application etc), you will have to correct the paths to bin and lib folders in
the build.xml.</p>

<p>This
build.xml file includes TA/TP enhancement (normal and collections) and NQ
optimization. These are the default options. For a more detailed description of
Ant instrumentation the following options can be used:</p>

<p><b>nq</b>: switch for
native query optimization enhancement</p>

<p><b>ta</b>: switch for
transparent activation/persistence enhancement</p>

<p><b>collections</b>: switch
for enhancement of platform collections for transparent activation/persistence
(only effective if ta is switched on)</p>

<p>In order to
run the enhancement you can just type "ant" in the command line in your project's
directory. </p>

<p>You can
also integrate this build in the build process in your IDE. If you are using
Eclipse follow these steps:</p>

<ul><li>Right-click the project in the Package Explorer
and select "Properties"</li><li>Select "Builders" in the left pane</li><li>Add new builder after the default Java builder,
call it "Enhancement"</li><li>Select the build.xml file on the "Main" tab of
the new builder properties</li></ul>







<p>Now enhancement will be run after the normal
compilation (you may need to clean and rebuild the project to see the effect).</p>
