        <h1>.NET Enumerations</h1>

<p>.NET
enumerations are value types, just like integers, numbers, Booleans etc. Value
types are different from reference types in the way they are allocated:
reference types are allocated on the common language runtime (CLR) heap,
whereas value types are allocated in the stack or as a part of the reference
type.</p>

<p>.NET enumerations are based on an underlying type, which can
be Byte, SByte, Int32, UInt32, Int16, UInt16, Int64, and UInt64 (i.e. values of
these types will be enumerated). When underlying type is not specified in the
Enum declaration, Int32(c#) or Integer (VB.NET) is used by default. </p>

<p>Originally db4o was treating Enums as reference types, as the
abilities of db4o typehandlers were limited. With the introduction of the new <a href="../../typehandlers.htm" class="wikiLink">TypeHandlers</a>,
it became possible to align the persistence strategy with the runtime handling
strategy. Enums are now handled with a special EnumTypeHandler, which
implements IEmbeddedTypeHandler interface. It means that the enum object does
not have a database identity and will be stored together with its parent object
in the same slot. This handling is similar to the handling of a normal integer
field value with a limited value range. </p>

<p>EnumTypeHandler ensures that the new value of the Enum field
does not constitute a creation of a new database object. It also fixes the bug
of the previous handler when the "0" value was treated as "any" value of the
current enumeration.</p>
