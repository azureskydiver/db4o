        <h1>Collections Or Arrays</h1>
<P>If you are planning an application with db4o, you may be asking yourself, what is better to use: collections or arrays? In the current implementation it is not really a difficult choice, as collections internally are stored as arrays, which is explained in <a href="../collections.html" class="wikiLink">Collections</a> chapter. You can base your solution on the overall system design, entrusting db4o to handle the internals efficiently in both cases.</P>
<P>However if you are looking into the future you might want to design your system in a way that can easily be switched to the next db4o planned feature: Fast Collections. For more details see <a href="fast_collections.html" class="wikiLink">Fast collections</a>. Please, feel free to use db4o Jira to track <U><A href="http://tracker.db4o.com/browse/COR-113">the feature</A></U> progress and be notified on the latest updates.</P></div>
