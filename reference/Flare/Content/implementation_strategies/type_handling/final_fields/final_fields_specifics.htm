                <p>Db4o uses reflection to store and retrieve objects from the
database file. In the case of final fields db4o needs a successful call to
java.lang.Field#setAccessible to allow write access to those fields.
Unfortunately different Java versions produce different results in this case.
To be more specific:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In (Sun) JDK 1.1-1.2
     java.lang.Field#setAccessible call will be successful for the fields with
     the final modifier. </li>
                    <li>This behavior was changed for
     JDK1.3-1.4 as the API documentation for java.lang.Field#set() made a quite
     clear distinction between 'Java language access control' (visibility
     modifiers, affected by setAccessible()) and final fields (not affected by
     setAccessible()). For more information refer to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4250960">java bug
     4250960</a>.</li>
                    <li>The
     behavior of java.lang.Field#setAccessible method was changed again for
     JDK5 and JDK6. The access to final fields was made manageable by
     setAccessible() call to accommodate for the extended semantics of the
     final modifier for the revised Java memory model. The API documentation of
     java.lang.Field#set() was changed accordingly. See <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5044412">java bug
     5044412</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can use the following example code to check final fields
behavior with different java versions:</p>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Final Fields Specifics/TestFinal.java/TestFinal.java.flsnp" />
                <p>If you are using Eclipse it is easy to switch between java
versions - you can switch to the versions lower than the one installed on your
computer without having to install them all. For example if you are using JDK6
you can easily test your project on JDK1.1 - 1.4 and JDK5. Just go to the project
properties, select "Java Build Path" on the left panel and "Libraries" tab on
the right panel. Remove the system library currently used. Select "Add
library-&gt;JRE System Library"; on the next screen check the "Execution
Environment" radio button and select the desired environment from the list.</p>Don't forget to use the appropriate db4o version for
the selected java environment version. See
<a href="../../../platform_specific_issues/db4o_on_java_platforms.htm"  >db4o on Java Platforms</a>for more information.
