<p>In .NET version TList , TDictionary, TQueue and TStack classes represent collection
translators. Internally they are used to store ArrayList, Hashtable, Queue and
Stack classes accordingly. </p>
</p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:net" />
<p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">
<p>In Java version TVector and THashtable classes represent collection translators. Internally they are used to store  Vector and Hashtable classes accordingly. </p>
</p><p MadCap:conditions="Primary:java" />
<p>The functionality of these translators is pretty
straightforward:</p>

<ul>
<li>OnStore
     the members of the object are moved to an object array (Entry array for
     TDictionary and THashtable).</li>
<li>OnActivate
     a new collection object is constructed from the array values.</li>
</ul>

In general you will never need to use any of these
translators as all the work is done for you under the hood. However you might
be interested to have a look at their code if you are planning a totally new
custom collection implementation (not CollectionBase derived). The source code
for collection translators can be found in Db4objects.Db4o.Config namespace/com.db4o.config package.
