        <h1>Configure IDMapping</h1>
        <p>When you defragment the database the objects get potentially a new id. To keep track which old id maps the which new id a IDMapper is uses. You can change the IDMapper or even implement your own.</p>
        <p>By default the InMemoryIdMapping is uses, which is the fastest version, but consumes the most memory. As alterative there's the DatabaseIdMapping available, which stores mapping in a file and therefore uses less memory.</p>
