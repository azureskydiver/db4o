        <h1>Commit Frequency</h1>
        <p>The defragmentation system uses transaction db4o core to write the data to the new defragmented file. For large databases managing a long transaction can become a issue and make defragmentation slow. Therefore you can set a commit frequency. This means after the set number of processed objects the transaction is committed on the new file. </p>
