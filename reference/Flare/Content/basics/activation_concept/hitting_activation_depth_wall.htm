        <h1>Activation In Action</h1>
        <p>Let's see db4o's activation in action. To see activation you need a deep object-graph. To keep this example simple we create a person-class with a mother-field. This allows us to simply create a very deep object graph.</p>
        <p>First the Person class:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/pitfalls/activation/Person-Person-with-a-reference-to-the-mother.all.flsnp" />
        <p>After that we store a deep hierarchy of persons. Let's say we store a hierarchy of seven people. Then we query for it and traverse this object graph. When we hit the sixth person, that object won't be activated, because it's outside the activation depth. That object will have all fields set to null.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/pitfalls/activation/ActivationDepthPitfall-run-into-not-activated-objects.all.flsnp" />
        <h2>Use Explicit Activation</h2>
        <p>When we traverse deep object graphs, we know that we might run into not activated objects. Therefore you can activate objects explicitly.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/pitfalls/activation/ActivationDepthPitfall-Fix-with-explicit-activation.all.flsnp" />
        <h2>Configure Activation</h2>
        <p>You can configure db4o to increase the activation depth. You can increase it <a href="../../configuration/common/activation_depth.htm">globally</a> or for <a href="../../configuration/objectclass/minimum_activation_depth.htm">certain classes</a>. Or you can <a href="../../configuration/objectclass/cascade_on-activate.htm">cascade activate</a> certain objects.</p>
        <p>However remember that activation is there to improve the performance and save memory. If you set the activation depth to high it will hurt the performance.</p>
        <h2>Transparent Activation</h2>
        <p>If you have a very complex model or don't want to deal with all the activation hassle then transparent activation is the best option. Transparent activation will manage the activation for you. <MadCap:xref href="transparent_activation_framework.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Activation Framework"</MadCap:xref></p>
