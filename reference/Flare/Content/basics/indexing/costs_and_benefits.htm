        <h1>Costs And Benefits</h1>
        <p>Maintaining an index is additional work and therefore it has its costs. Each time you store a objects which has an index on it, db4o needs to look up the a appropriate place in the index and store a entry there. This costs is paid for each store, update or delete operation. Therefore there's a tradeoff when adding indexes.</p>
        <p>The costs are mostly the time consumed to maintain the index. Additionally there's some additional space consumed to store the index. The benefits is that queries which run a order of magnitude faster when using an index.</p>
        <p>In practice you should measure and benchmark your solution and check if a index is a benefit to your application. Ensure that you have enough test data. The influence of indexes shows better with a lot of objects. (10'000 and more objects). However since most applications do a lot more read operations than store and update operations adding a index brings a huge benefit.</p>
