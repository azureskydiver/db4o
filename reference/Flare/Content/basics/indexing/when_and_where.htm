        <h1>When And Where</h1>
        <p>When do you need an index? And on which fields do I need an index? An index has a costs and benefits. <MadCap:xref href="costs_and_benefits.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Costs And Benefits"</MadCap:xref>. Therefore you should only add one when you actually benefit from it.</p>
        <h2>When To Add Queries</h2>
        <p>Indexes speed up queries but slow down store and delete operations. You only need to add indexes when queries are too slow. There's no real benefit to add a index when your queries are already fast enough.</p>
        <p>Also add index only on fields which are used in queries. Indexes on fields which are never used in a query have no benefit.</p>
        <h2>Where To Add Queries</h2>
        <p>How do I find the queries which can benefit from indexes? How do I find queries which couldn't utilize indexes? You can use the <a href="../../configuration/common/diagnostics.htm">diagnostic-API</a> find out. Filter for the LoadedFromClassIndex-message. Every time this message arrives the query didn't use a field index. You can add a break-point to the message-output and find out which query is the source and then add the index.</p>
