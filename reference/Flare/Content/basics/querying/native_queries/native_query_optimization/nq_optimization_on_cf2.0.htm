        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">
            <p>Due to some platform limitations, CompactFramework 2.0 users using the more 
convenient delegate based Native Query syntax that want their queries to be 
optimized are required to run the Db4oTool.exe command line utility on their 
assemblies prior to deploying them. <MadCap:xref href="../../../../implementation_strategies/enhancement_tools.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Enhancement Tools"</MadCap:xref></p>
            <p>The utility, which can be found in 
the /bin folder of .NET distribution, is required because the CompactFramework 
API does not expose any of the delegate metadata needed by the Native Query 
optimizer. The tool works by augmenting the bytecode with the necessary delegate 
metadata and replacing ObjectContainer#Query invocations with 
invocations to a lower level method that makes use of the additional 
information.</p>
