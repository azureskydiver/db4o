<p>The advantage of using Isolated Storage is in the ability to
get storage space for any user rights. However, there are serious limitations,
which should be considered before choosing Isolated Storage:</p>

<ol>
<li>Isolated
     Storage quotas can be assigned to a user by system administrator, so the
     application must be ready to face a situation when the database file has
     no more space available to grow (in this case db4o switches to the
     <a href="../../tuning/configuration/general_configuration.html" class="wikiLink">ReadOnly</a> mode automatically).</li>
<li>Isolated
     Storage is intended for a per-user use, so it does not make sense to try
     Isolated Storage for a multi-user access to db4o.</li>
<li>Code
     must have the IsolatedStorageFilePermission to work with
     isolated storage. This can be a problem if your machine is severely locked
     down by administrative security policies.</li>
</ol>
