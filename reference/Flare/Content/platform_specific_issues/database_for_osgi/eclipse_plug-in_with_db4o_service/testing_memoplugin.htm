                <h1>Testing MemoPlugin</h1>
                <p>Eclipse environment makes it very
easy to test plug-in projects: you do not need to exit your workspace or
manually activate plug-ins.</p>
                <p>In order to test the new
MemoPlugin, open plugin.xml by double-clicking the file in Package Explorer,
select Overview tab and click "Launch an Eclipse application" link.</p>
                <p>If everything worked out right,
you should see "Sample Menu" with a "Sample Action" submenu. Click "Sample
Action", you should see a window like this:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Memoplugin.JPG" />
                </p>
                <p>Try to add and delete several items. You can close the window and
open it again to check that the changes are saved. You can also test the same
after restarting Eclipse to see that the changes are not lost between sessions. </p>Note, that the database file is created in the
ECLIPSE_HOME, so you must have write and create writes there.
