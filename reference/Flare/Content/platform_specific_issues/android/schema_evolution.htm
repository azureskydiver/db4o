        <h1>Schema Evolution</h1>
        <p>When a new application development is considered it is
important to think about its evolution. What happens if your initial model does
not suffice and you need changes or additions? Let's look how db4o and SQLite
applications can handle it.</p>
        <p>To keep the example simple, let's add a registration record
to our car:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/Android/src/com/db4odoc/android/Car-Add-a-new-field-to-the-car.all.flsnp" />
        <p>Ok, the application is changed to take care for the new class. What
about our databases?</p>
        <h3>Schema Evolution in db4o</h3>
        <p>db4o supports such schema change on the fly: we can select
values and update the new field too: </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/Android/src/com/db4odoc/android/Db4oExample-update-a-car-with-db4o.all.flsnp" />
        <h3>Schema Evolution in SQLite</h3>
        <p>For SQLite database model should be synchronized with the
object model:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/Android/src/com/db4odoc/android/SqlExample-upgrade-schema-in-SQLite.all.flsnp" />
        <p>Now we can try to retrieve and update records:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/Android/src/com/db4odoc/android/SqlExample-update-a-car-with-SQLite.all.flsnp" />
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>You can see that schema evolution is much easier with db4o.
But the main difficulty that is not visible from the example is that schema
evolution with SQLite database can potentially introduce a lot of bugs that
will be difficult to spot. For more information see
