            <MadCap:keyword term="Silverlight" />Silverlight</h1>
        <p>db4o runs with some limitations on Microsoft's Silverlight. You can find the Silverlight assemblies in the db4o distribution, in the folder 'bin/silverlight'. </p>
        <h2>Feature Set</h2>
        <p>Currently on a very limited feature set is supported. Right now only the db4o core is supported. This means that there's no LINQ-support and no client server mode.</p>
        <h2>Isolated Storage</h2>
        <p>By default you cannot access the file system from Silverlight, but only a special isolated storage. Therefore you need to use the isolated storage system also for db4o. Note that by default this storage is limited to 1 MByte of data. You <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.isolatedstorage.isolatedstoragefile.increasequotato(v=VS.95).aspx">can increase it with</a> the users consent.</p>

        <h2>Persistent Object Limitations</h2>
        <p>Due to the restrictions of the Silverlight sandbox, it's impossible to inspect the private fields of an object. This means that the field of persistent objects need to be public!</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/silverlight/model/Person-fields-need-to-be-public-to-be-persisted.all.flsnp" />
        <h2>Query Limitations</h2>
        <p>As for now, the Silverlight port of db4o doesn't support LINQ. You can use <a href="../object_lifecycle/querying/native_queries.htm">native queries</a>, but those are not optimized on the Silverlight platform and therefore slow. The only efficient query-method for now it using <a href="../object_lifecycle/querying/soda_query.htm">SODA directly</a>. </p>
