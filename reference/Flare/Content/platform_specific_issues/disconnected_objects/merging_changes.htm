        <h1>Merging Changes</h1>
        <p>Merging the changes is the most challenging part when using disconnected objects. Imagine that we've a disconnected object, which contains the changes. We have to store the changes somehow. You cannot simply store the disconnected objects, because db4o wouldn't recognize it and store a new object instead of updating the old object. <MadCap:xref href="wrong_approach.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Wrong Approach"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Instead you need to load the existing object and then copy the state from the disconnected object to the loaded object. Basically you traverse the object-graph and copy all changes over.     <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:xref href="example_merge_changes.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Example Merge Changes"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>db4o has no built-in merge support. However there are external libraries which can help you to merge changes, like <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/" MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">Automapper</a> <![CDATA[ ]]><a href="http://dozer.sourceforge.net/" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">Dozer</a>.</p>
