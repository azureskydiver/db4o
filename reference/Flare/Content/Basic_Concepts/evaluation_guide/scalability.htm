        <h1>Scalability</h1>
        <p>Db4o can potentially be used for rather large databases - up to 254 GB per database file.   However, this would be highly unusual and likely due to having the kind of application that was storing relatively few, but very large objects in the database.   As a general rule, if you expect your database to grow beyond 10 gigabytes, you should probably be looking at the Versant object database.  For more information, please visit:   <a href="http://www.versant.com/en_US/products/objectdatabase?referrer=vsnt2">http://www.versant.com/</a></p>
        <p>If you want to make sure that your
application can grow and scale with db4o database you may take the following
steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write performance tests to accommodate for performance requirements
     of the growing application</li>
            <li>Use database clusters to spread the load between several
     database files.</li>
            <li>Use client-server version to enable many clients using
     data at the same time</li>
            <li>Use in-memory database to improve performance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another important factor for performance and scalability is
fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs when your objects grow in size regularly or when you application deletes lots of objects through normal processing. That is why it is important to run db4o <a href="../../tuning/performance_hints/defragment.htm">Defragment</a>regularly. The physical disk fragmentation also plays an important role, so disk defragment should be also scheduled on a regular basis to improve the performance.   The db4o defragmentation tool is an off-line tool.  If you require online administration of actives such as defragmentation, you should probably be considering the Versant object database.
