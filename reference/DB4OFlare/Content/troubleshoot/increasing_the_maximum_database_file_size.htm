        <h1>Increasing the Maximum Database File Size</h1>
        <p>To increase the database size you need to increase the block size. This configuration setting has only an effect when you create a new database or when you defragment an existing database. <MadCap:xref href="../configuration/file/block_size.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Block Size"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>When you want to know what contributes to the <a href="database_size.htm">database file size see here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Advantage</h2>
        <p>Increasing the block size from the default of one to a higher value permits you to store more data in a db4o database.</p>
        <h2>Effect</h2>
        <p>By
default db4o databases can have a maximum size of 2GB. By
increasing the block size, the upper
limit for database files sizes can be raised to multiples of 2GB. Any
value between 1 byte (2GB) to 127 bytes (254GB) can be chosen as the
block size.</p>
        <p>Because of possible padding for objects that are not
exact multiples in length of the block size, database files will
naturally tend to be bigger when a higher value is chosen. It may also leads to more file cache misses and therefore can decrease performance.</p>
        <p>A very good choice for this value is 8, because that corresponds to the slot length of the pointers
(address + length) that db4o internally uses.</p>
