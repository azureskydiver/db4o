        <h1>ASP.NET Security</h1>
        <p>It is characteristic to web-applications that there are some security permissions involved, which can in fact forbid db4o functionality in your ASP.NET application. So, before developing/deploying you should make sure that the required permissions would be granted to your application at the hosting server:</p>
        <OL>
            <LI>ASP.NET user should have read/write permissions to the directory containing database file. Obviously this is necessary to work with the database.</LI>
            <LI>
                <p>Trust Level of your site should be set to "Full".</p>
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <p>All the necessary permissions should be granted to db4o assembly. The easiest way to ensure this is to add full trust to db4o by installing it in GAC.</p>
            </LI>
            <p>If full trust is not a suitable solution for, you can check the minimum security permissions that db4o-assembly needs to operate using permcalc.exe tool from your Visual Studio installation. </p>
            <p><code>PermCalc.exe -Sandbox Db4objects.Db4o.dll</code>
            </p>

            <p>Consult with your web-server administrator to grant these permissions. <a href="../sandbox.permcalc.xml">permcalc.xml</a></p>
