    <h1>db4o on .NET Platforms</h1>
    <a name="All .NET"></a>
    <h2>All .NET</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>.NET version of db4o uses Pascal case for method names</li>
      <li>Root namespace is Db4objects.Db4o</li>
      <li>All namespaces start with upper case letter</li>
      <li>Interface names have an <b>I</b> prefix</li>
      <li>.NET Reflection mechanism adds assembly name to class definition. If you use db4o database with two applications (client and server) you'll have to move all persistent class definitions into a shared .dll. Identical classes compiled into different executables/libraries will be treated as different.</li>
      <li>Enumerations are treated as integer types</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please, refer to <a href="security_requirements_on_.net_platform.htm">Security Requirements On .NET Platform</a> for further information.</p>
    <h2>.NET Compact Framwork</h2>
    <p>Due to some platform limitations nativ queries cannot be optimized at runtime. Use <a href="../basics/querying/linq.htm">LINQ</a> as a better alternative. Or you can use the Db4oTool.exe command line utility on their assemblies prior to deploying them.</p>
