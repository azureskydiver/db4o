        <h1>Scalability</h1>
        <p>db4o is intended for embedded use with smaller databases around 2-16 GByte and at maximum 256 GByte. As a general rule, if you expect your database to grow beyond 16 gigabytes, you should look at the <a href="http://www.versant.com/" target="_top">Versant object database</a>.</p>
        <p>db4o is explicitly single-threaded. Concurrent accesses will be synchronized against a global database lock.That means db4o cannot deal with a highly concurrent access, since it blocks on all operations. When you expect a high load and concurrent access, then you should consider a larger database like the <a href="http://www.versant.com/" target="_top">Versant object database</a>.</p>
        <p>If you want to make sure that your
application can grow and scale with db4o database you may take the following
steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write performance tests to accommodate for performance requirements
     of the growing application. Especially look that you capture the complexity of the model and don't use a simplified flat data model.</li>
            <li>Also check that you can the throughput you need with concurrent access.</li>
        </ul>
