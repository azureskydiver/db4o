        <h1>Basics Operations &amp; Concepts</h1>
        <p>This topic gives you an overview of the most important and basic operations of db4o. First add db4o to your project. db4o doesn't need a complex setup. It's just a library which you can add to your project. <MadCap:xref href="basics/getting_started.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Getting Started"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h2>Basic Operations</h2>
        <p>The basic operations are, not surprising, storing, updating, querying and deleting objects. <MadCap:xref href="basics/object_container.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "The Basic Operations"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="CodeExamples/basics/Db4oBasics-The-basic-operations.all.flsnp" />
        <p>For more information about queries: <MadCap:xref href="basics/querying.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Querying"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
        <p>There are some basic concepts which are used in db4o. Understanding them helps to understand how db4o behaves. Some behaviors are common behaviors which you expect from a database, like transactions and ACID properties. <MadCap:xref href="basics/acid_and_transactions.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "ACID Properties And Transactions"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>db4o manages objects by identity. This means db4o doesn't need additional id-field on your object. <MadCap:xref href="basics/identity_concept.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Identity Concept"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Other concepts are more unique to db4o. For example the activation concept, which controls which objects are loaded from the storage to memory. <MadCap:xref href="basics/activation.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Activation Concept"</MadCap:xref>. The same principals are also applied when updating (<MadCap:xref href="basics/update_concept.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Update Concept" </MadCap:xref> ) or deletion objects (<MadCap:xref href="basics/delete_behavior.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Delete Behavior")</MadCap:xref></p>
