    <p>A db4o database file is structured as sets of free and
occupied slots, similar to a file system. And just like a file system it
can be fragmented, resulting in a file that is larger than it needs to be.</p>
    <p>The defragmentation API helps to fix this problem. It creates a new
database file and copies all objects from the current database file to the new
database file. All indexes are recreated. The resulting database file will be
smaller and faster. It is recommended to apply defragmentation on a regular basis
to achieve better performance.</p>
    <p>Take a look how to defragment your database. <MadCap:xref href="defragment/how_to_use_defragmentation.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "How To Use Defragmentation"</MadCap:xref></p>
    <p>Take a look at the defragmentation configuration options. <MadCap:xref href="defragment/defragmentation_configuration.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Defragmentation Configuration"</MadCap:xref></p>
    <p>You can register a defragmentation listener which notifies you for certain issues: <MadCap:xref href="defragment/tracking_defragmentation_errors.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Tracking Defragmentation Errors"</MadCap:xref></p>
