        <p>db4o supplies hot backup functionality to backup single-user databases and client-server databases while they are running.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/backup/BackupExample-Store-a-backup-while-using-the-database.all.flsnp" />
        <p>Maybe you want to use a other storage system for the backup than the main database. You can specify the storage system for the backup directly:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/backup/BackupExample-Store-a-backup-with-storage.all.flsnp" />
        <p>The methods can be called while an object container is open and they will execute with low priority in a dedicated thread, with as little impact on processing performance as possible.
        All concurrent changes to the database will be applied to the backup as well. This process will usually take significantly longer than a plain file copy.</p>
        <p>To perform a faster backup that blocks all concurrent database activity, use <b>backupSync</b> instead.</p>
