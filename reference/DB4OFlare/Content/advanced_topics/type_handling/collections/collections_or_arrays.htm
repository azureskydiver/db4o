    <h1>Collections Or Arrays</h1>
    <P>If you are planning an application with db4o, you may be asking yourself, what is better to use: collections or arrays? In the current implementation it is not really a difficult choice, as collections internally are stored as arrays, which is explained in <a href="../collections.htm">Collections</a> chapter. You can base your solution on the overall system design, entrusting db4o to handle the internals efficiently in both cases.</P>
    <P>However you need to consider that collections are more flexible and convenient than arrays for most operations. Additionally, collections can be TA/TP aware by using db4o-collections, while arrays are always fully activated. <MadCap:xref href="../../../basics/activation_concept/transparent_activation_framework/Collections.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "TA Aware Collections"</MadCap:xref></P>
