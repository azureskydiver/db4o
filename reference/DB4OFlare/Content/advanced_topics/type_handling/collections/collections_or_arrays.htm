        <h1>Collections or Arrays?</h1>
        <P>If you are planning an application with db4o, you may be asking yourself, what is better to use: collections or arrays? From db4o's point of view it doesn't make a big difference. You can base your solution on the overall system design, entrusting db4o to handle the internals efficiently in both cases.</P>
        <P>However you need to consider that collections are more flexible and convenient than arrays for most operations. Additionally, collections can be TA/TP aware by using db4o-collections, while arrays are always fully activated. <MadCap:xref href="../../../basics/transparentpersistence/Collections.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "TA Aware Collections"</MadCap:xref></P>
