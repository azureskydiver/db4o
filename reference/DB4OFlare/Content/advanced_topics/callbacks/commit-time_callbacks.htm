    <h1>Commit-Time Callbacks</h1>
    <p>Commit-time callbacks allow a user to add some specific
behavior just before and just after a transaction is committed. </p>
    <p>Typical use-cases for commit-time callbacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add constraint-violation checking before commit.</li>
      <li>Check application-specific conditions before commit is done.</li>
      <li>Start synchronization or backup after commit.</li>
      <li>Notify other clients/applications about
successful/unsuccessful commit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Commit-time callbacks can be triggered by the following 2 events:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Committing</b>: Event
     subscribers are notified before the container starts any meaningful commit
     work and are allowed to cancel the entire operation by throwing an
     exception; the object container instance is completely blocked while
     subscribers are being notified which is both a blessing because
     subscribers can count on a stable and safe environment and a curse because
     it prevents any parallelism with the container;</li>
      <li>
        <b>Committed</b>:
Event subscribers are notified in a separate thread after the container has completely
finished the commit operation; exceptions if any will be ignored.

</li>
    </ul>
