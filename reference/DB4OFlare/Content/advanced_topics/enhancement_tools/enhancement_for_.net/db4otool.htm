    <h1>Db4oTool</h1>
    <p>Db4oTool.exe utility is distributed together with db4o .NET version and can be used for native query optimization and transparent activation instrumentation.</p>
    <p>The main use-cases for Db4oTool are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="../../../basics/querying/native_queries/native_query_optimization/nq_build_time_optimisation.htm">Optimization of native queries</a> at build time. This will improve Native Query performance by cutting of query analyzing time during execution.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="../../../basics/activation_concept/transparent_activation_framework.htm">Transparent Activation/Persistence</a> instrumentation. This will enable you to use transparent activation without modifying your classes or to use transparent activation on third-party classes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you use Db4oTool for use-cases one and two you will be able to distribute your application without Db4objects.Db4o.NativeQueries.dll (the assembly where the Native Query runtime optimizer lives).</p>
