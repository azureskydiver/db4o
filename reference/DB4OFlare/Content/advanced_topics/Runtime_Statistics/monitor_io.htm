        <h1>Monitor IO</h1>
        <p>You can monitor the IO-operations of db4o to find out more about the runtime behavior of your application.</p>
        <h2>Configure the IO Monitoring Support</h2>
        <p>In order to monitor the IO activities of db4o you need to configure the IO monitoring support.</p>

        <p><strong MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">BytesReadPerSecond</strong><strong MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">bytes read/sec</strong>: Tells you how many bytes are read per second from the disk.</p>
        <p><strong MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">BytesWrittenPerSecond</strong><strong MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">bytes written/sec</strong>: Tells you how many bytes are written to disk per second.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java"><strong>ReadsPerSecond</strong>: Tells how many read requests are issues per second.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java"><strong>SyncsPerSecond</strong>: Tells you how many sync-operations are done per second. The sync-operation is a part of the commit-process. I forces the runtime and operating system to flush all buffers to the disk to ensure that the data are safely stored. The sync operation is normally a costly operation, since it need to wait on the physical disk to finish all write operations</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">.<strong>WritesPerSecond</strong>: Tells you how may write requests are issued per second.</p>
