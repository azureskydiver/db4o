        <h1>Commit Frequency</h1>
        <p>The defragmentation system uses db4o's transactional core to write the data to the new defragmented file. For large databases managing a long transaction can become an issue and can slow down the defragmentation. Therefore you can set a commit frequency. This means after the set number of processed objects the transaction is committed on the new file. </p>
