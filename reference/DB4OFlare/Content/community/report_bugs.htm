        <h2>Where Do I&#160;Report Bugs?</h2>
        <p>The best way to report a bug is to report it on our issue <a href="http://tracker.db4o.com/" target="_parent">tracking system</a>. The login for the bug tracker is the same as in the db4o community page and db4o forums. If you don't have a login yet you can register <a href="http://community.versant.com/register.aspx" target="_parent">here</a>. </p>
        <p>In cases you are not sure if the issue is an bug or another problem you maybe want to discuss it in the <a href="http://community.versant.com/register.aspx">db4o forums</a>.</p>
        <h2>What Should the Bug Report Contain?</h2>
        <p>The bug report should be as specific as possible, so that the room for interpretation is very small:</p>

            <li>When possible include a the test-code which reproduces the issue. <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
