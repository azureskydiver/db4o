        <p>Find a bug in db4o?&#160;Here are a few tips and tricks for reporting bugs.</p>
        <h2>Where Do I&#160;Report Bugs?</h2>
        <p>The best way to report bugs is to directly report the bug in our issue <a href="http://tracker.db4o.com/" target="_parent">tracking system here</a>. The login for the bug tracker is the same as in the db4o community page and db4o forums. If you don't have a login yet you can register <a href="http://www.db4o.com/Users/register.aspx" target="_parent">here</a>. </p>
        <p>In cases where you are not sure if the issue is an bug or another problem you maybe want to first discuss it in the <a href="http://www.db4o.com/Users/register.aspx">db4o forums</a>.</p>
        <h2>What Should The Bug Report Contain?</h2>
        <p>The bug report should be as specific as possible, so that the room for interpretation is very small. Those items are important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steps to reproduce the bug. In order to fix the bug a step by step instructions on how to reproduce the issue are essential.</li>
            <li>Include the db4o version in your bug report. <span MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">The complete version of db4o is included in the jar-name. </span><span MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">To see the version you can right click on the db4o assembly, go to 'Properties', then to the tab 'Details' and read the version there in the 'Product Version' section.</span></li>
            <li>Include information about your platform. <span MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">Which Java Version and what kind of device (like Android). </span> <![CDATA[ ]]><span>Which .NET version and what kind of device (for example a embedded system)</span></li>
            <li>In case of exceptions, please add also the stack trace.</li>
