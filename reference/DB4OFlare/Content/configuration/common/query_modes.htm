    <h1>Query Modes</h1>
    <p>What is the best way to process queries? How to get
the optimum performance for your application needs?</p>
    <p>Situations, when query result is bigger than the memory
available or when query time is longer than the whole functional operation.</p>
    <p>Luckily db4o takes most of the trouble for itself.
There are three query modes allowing to fine tune the balance between speed, memory
consumption and availability of the results:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="query_modes/immediate_queries.htm">Immediate</a>: The default mode. The result is determined immediately and only the objects are lazy loaded.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="query_modes/lazy_queries.htm">Lazy</a>: The query is evaluated while iterating to the result.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="query_modes/snapshot_queries.htm">Snapshot</a>: Runs the index-processing and creates a snapshot of the result. Further processing is done while iterating over the result.</li>
    </ul>
