        <h1>Recovery Mode</h1>
        <p><strong>This option only makes sense when you try to recover a corrupted database.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Turns recovery mode on and off. Recovery mode can be used to try to retrieve as much as possible out of an corrupted database. In recovery mode internal  checks are more relaxed. Null or invalid objects may be returned  instead of throwing exceptions. Use this method with care as a last resort to get data out of a corrupted database.</p>
