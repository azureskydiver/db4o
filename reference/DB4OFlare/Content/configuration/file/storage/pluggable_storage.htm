        <h1>Pluggable Storage</h1>
        <p>You can implement a storage mechanism yourself. It can be memory,
native IO, encrypted storage, mirrored storage etc.</p>
        <p>The implementation is guided by two interfaces. The storage interface which represents a 'file'-system where multiple stored databases can live. And the bin interface which represents the storage access.</p>
        <p>When you only need a decorator for existing storage implementations, then you can base your implementation on the StorageDecorator and BinDecorator classes. These classes delegate all calls to the underlying implementation, but give you a chance to override certain methods to intercept the calls.</p>
        <h2>Logging-Storage Example</h2>
        <p>This example just logs all calls to the storage system:</p>
