        <p>Here's an example to demonstrate the isolation level issues. We have two bank accounts. One transaction lists the two bank accounts and sums up the total. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/transactions/InconsistentStateRead-We-list-the-bank-accounts-and-sum-up-the-money.all.flsnp">
        </MadCap:snippetBlock>
        <p>During that operation another transaction finishes a money transfer from on account to another and commits.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/transactions/InconsistentStateRead-Meanwhile-we-transfer-money.all.flsnp" />
        <p> Now the other transaction sees one bank account previous transfer, the other account is in the last committed state. Therefore it sees an inconsistent view on these two objects.</p>
