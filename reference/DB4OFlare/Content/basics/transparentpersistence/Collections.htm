        <p>In order to support transparent persistence properly a class needs to implement the   <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:variable name="Primary.Activatable" />-interface. For your domain classes this is easy to archive. But what about the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Plattform" />-collections? Wouldn't it be nice when collections also work together the transparent activation framework?</p>
        <p>db4o brings special, transparent persistence aware collections with it. This collections load the content only when the collections is actually used.</p>
        <p>These collections are currently implemented:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Snippets/TA_TP_collection_list.flsnp" />
        <p>It's recommended to use the collection-interfaces wherever possible instead of the concrete classes. This avoids unnecessary direct dependencies on the implementations and makes it easy to exchange the implementations.</p>
        <p>The enhancement tools can automatically replace the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Plattform" />-collections with the db4o-equivalent. However there are few rules and limitations. <MadCap:xref href="collections/enhance_collections.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Enhance Collections"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>You can use the db4o-collection directly in your code. For example in the case you implement the transparent activation support manually.
