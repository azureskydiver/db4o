        <h1>TA Enhancement At Loading Time</h1>
        <p>TA Instrumentation at loading time is the most convenient as the classes do not have to be modified, only a separate runner class should be created to enable special instrumenting classloader to deal with the classes.</p>
        <p>The following configuration should be
used:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/TA Enhancement At Loading Time/TAInstrumentationExample.java/configureTA.flsnp" />
        <p>The main method should
provide the testing code:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/TA Enhancement At Loading Time/TAInstrumentationExample.java/main.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/TA Enhancement At Loading Time/TAInstrumentationExample.java/storeSensorPanel.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/TA Enhancement At Loading Time/TAInstrumentationExample.java/testActivation.flsnp" />
        <p>A separate class should be used to
run the instrumented example. This class creates a filter to point to the classes that should be instrumented, in this case ByNameClassFilter is used. You can see other filters in ClassFilter hierarchy. A special BloatClassEdit is created to instruct, which type of instrumentation will be used (InjectTransparentActivationEdit in our case). This configuration together with the path of the classes to be instrumented is passed to Db4oInstrumentationLauncher. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/TA Enhancement At Loading Time/TAInstrumentationRunner.java/TAInstrumentationRunner.java.flsnp" />you can run the example by running Db4oInstrumentationLauncher, which will start TAInstrumentationExample in a correct configuration.
