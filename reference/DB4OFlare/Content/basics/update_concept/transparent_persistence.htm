    <p>One of db4o's goals is to make the database transparent to the
application logic. Wouldn't it be nice to initially register an
object  with a single store()-call and then let the database manage all future object modifications? Transparent Persistence does exactly that.It keeps track of changes and stores all modified objects automatically when committing. </p>
    <p>This has several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean an refactorable code. The code doesn't depend on the right activation-depth. </li>
      <li>Performance-benefits. Only the objects which are needed are loaded into memory. And only modified objects are stored.</li>
      <li>No changes can be lost due to miss configured update-depth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Transparent persistence takes care of activating the objects and storing changes. Take a look a simple example. <MadCap:xref href="transparent_persistence/transparent_persistence_example.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Persistence Example"</MadCap:xref></p>
    <p>In order to support transparent persistence the persisted object need to implement certain interfaces. To manually implementing this interface is time consuming. Therefore it can be automated with enhancement tools. <MadCap:xref href="transparent_persistence/tp_enhanced_example.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Persistence Enhancement"</MadCap:xref></p>
    <p>When using Transparent Persistence collections might need special attention. <MadCap:xref href="transparent_persistence/collection_example.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Persistence Collections"</MadCap:xref></p>
