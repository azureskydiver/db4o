      <MadCap:keyword term="Transparent Persistence:Collections" />Transparent Persistence Collections</h1>
    <p>In the <a href="transparent_persistence_example.htm">previous example</a> we reviewed how Transparent Persistence should be used with simple types. For your domain classes this is quite easy to archive. But what about the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Plattform" />-collections? Wouldn't it be nice when the collections also work together the transparent persistence framework? So that when you add a object to a persistent collection, the object is also stored when committing?</p>
    <p>For this purpose db4o brings special, transparent persistence aware collections with it. These collections store the added objects when on commit. </p>
    <p>These are the same collections as for transparent activation and you can use them exactly the same way. <MadCap:xref href="../../activation_concept/transparent_activation_framework/Collections.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "TA Aware Collections"</MadCap:xref></p>
