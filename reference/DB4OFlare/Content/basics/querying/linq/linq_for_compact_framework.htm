    <h1>LINQ For Compact Framework</h1>
    <p>Compact Framework version 3.5
contains LINQ implementation for querying objects, however it does
not contain the namespace System.Linq.Expressions, which is used by
all optimized LINQ providers. Luckily there is a solution to this
problem. Mono implementation of System.Core can be used to support
optimized LINQ providers and expression interpreter contributed by
<a href="http://www.mainsoft.com/">Mainsoft</a> to Mono's
System.Core can be used to support full LINQ expression trees.
</p>
    <p>These assemblies were used by db4o team to compile a new assembly,
System.Linq.Expressions.dll, which provides LINQ support to .NET
Compact Framework 3.5. In order to use the full LINQ functionality including optimization, add a reference to System.Linq.Expressions.dll in your project and enjoy. <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
