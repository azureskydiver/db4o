    <h1>Query By Example Limitations</h1>
    <p>Query By Example has by design a lot of limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You cannot perform advanced query expressions. (
OR, NOT, etc.)</li>
      <li>You cannot constrain for default-values like 0 on numbers, empty strings or nulls on references because they would be interpreted as 
unconstrained.</li>
      <li>You need a constructor to create objects 
without initialized fields.</li>
      <li>Complex queries by example are not easy to read and interpret what they query for.</li>
    </ul>
