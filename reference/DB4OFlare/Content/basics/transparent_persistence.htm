        <p>One of challenges with db4o is to manage the <a href="activation.htm">activation of objects</a>. Also <a href="update_concept.htm">updating</a> only the changed objects can be a challenge. The transparent activation/persistence framework solves these issues.</p>
        <p>Transparent activation manages the activation of objects. It activates objects as soon as you access them. That means that you don't have to worry about the activation of an object. </p>
        <p>Transparent persistence builds on top of transparent activation and also manages updating objects. It monitors stored objects and memorizes changed objects. When you commit, the automatically stores all updated objects.</p>
        <p>Since transparent activation and persistence are very similar to implement. Therefore the same steps need to be taken to enable them. </p>
        <p>To get started take a look at an example. <MadCap:xref href="transparentpersistence/simple_example_tp.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Activation/Persistence Example".</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Maybe you want to know more details and take a look manually implementing the required interfaces.<MadCap:xref href="transparentpersistence/implementation.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Implementation".</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Collections need special attention in transparent activation / persistence. <MadCap:xref href="transparentpersistence/Collections.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Collections".</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Also take a look at rollback strategies, where db4o also handles to rollback of in memory objects. <MadCap:xref href="transparentpersistence/automatic_deactivation.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Automatic Rollback"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>And finally take a look at the pitfalls: <MadCap:xref href="transparentpersistence/transparent_activation_pitfalls.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Activation Pitfalls"</MadCap:xref></p>
