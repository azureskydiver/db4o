 </p>

<p>configures global activation depth, which will be used for all objects instead of the default value. This method should be called before opening a database file.</p>

 </p>



 </p>

<p>has a similar effect, but the setting will be applied to the specific ObjectContainer and can be changed for the open database file.</p>

 </p>

 </p>



<p>By configuring db4o you can have full control over activation behavior. The two extremes: </p>
<ul>
<li>using an activationDepth of Integer.MAX_VALUE lets you forget about manual activation, but does not give you the best performance and memory footprint; </li>
<li>using an activationDepth of 0 and activating and deactivating all objects manually keeps memory consumption extremely low, but needs more coding and attention.</li>
