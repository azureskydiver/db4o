<P>All work within db4o ObjectContainer is transactional. A transaction is implicitly started when you open a container, and the current transaction is implicitly committed when you close it again.</P>
<a name="Commit And Rollback"></a><H2>Commit And Rollback</H2>
<P>You may choose to make a commit explicit or you may leave it for the <code>#close()</code> call:</P>

 </P>
 </P>
<P>Before transaction is commited all the modifications to a database are written to a temporary memory storage. Commit (explicit or implicit) writes the modifications to the disk.</P>
<P>Please, remember to always commit or close your ObjectContainer when the work is done, to make sure that the data is saved to the permanent storage.</P>
<P>If you do not want to save changes to the database, you can call rollback, resetting the&nbsp;state of our database to the last commit point.</P>



<a name="Refresh Live Objects"></a><H2>Refresh Live Objects</H2>
<P>There is one thing that you should remember when rolling back: the <code>#rollback()</code> method will cancel the modifications, but it won't change back the state of the objects in your reference cache.</P>

 </P>

<P>You have to explicitly refresh your live objects when their state might become different from the state in the database:</P>

 </P>

<P>The <code>#refresh()</code> method might be also helpful when the changes to the database are done&nbsp;from different threads. See <a href="../Client-Server/Client-Server.html" class="wikiLink">Client-Server</a> for more information.</P></div>
