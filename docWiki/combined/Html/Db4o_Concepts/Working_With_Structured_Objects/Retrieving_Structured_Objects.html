Barrichello.</p> </p><p>What about retrieving a pilot by car? You simply don't need that -&nbsp;if you 
already know the car, you can simply access the pilot field&nbsp;directly.</p>

<a name="Native Queries"></a><h2>Native Queries</h2><p>Using native queries with constraints on deep structured objects&nbsp;is 
straightforward, you can do it just like you would in plain&nbsp;other code. 
<br><br>Let's constrain our query to only those cars driven by a Pilot&nbsp;with a 
specific name:</p>

 </p>

<a name="SODA Query API&nbsp;"></a><h2>SODA Query API&nbsp;</h2><p>In order to use SODA for querying for a car given its pilot's name you have&nbsp;to 
descend two levels into our query.</p>


 </p>


<p>You can also constrain the pilot field with a prototype to achieve&nbsp;the same 
result.</p>



 </p>



<p>Descending into a query provides you with another&nbsp;query. Starting out from a 
query root you can descend in multiple directions.&nbsp;In practice this is the same 
as ascending from one child to a parent&nbsp;and descending to another child. The 
queries turn&nbsp;one-directional references in objects into true relations.&nbsp;Here is 
an example that queries for "a Pilot that is being referenced&nbsp;by a Car, where 
the Car model is 'Ferrari'":</p>
