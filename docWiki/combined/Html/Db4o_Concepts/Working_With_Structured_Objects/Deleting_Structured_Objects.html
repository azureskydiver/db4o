<p>Fine, the car is gone. What about the pilots?</p>
&nbsp;

<p>Ok, this is no real surprise - we don't expect a pilot to vanish when his&nbsp;car is 
disposed of in real life, too. But what if we want an object's children&nbsp;to be 
thrown away on deletion, too?</p>
<a name="Recursive Deletion&nbsp;"></a><h2>Recursive Deletion&nbsp;</h2>
<p>You may already suspect that the problem of recursive deletion (and&nbsp;perhaps its 
solution, too) is quite similar to our little update problem, and you're&nbsp;right. 
Let's configure db4o to delete a car's pilot, too, when the car is deleted.</p>

</p>




 </p>















<p>Again: Note that all configuration must take place before the ObjectContainer is 
opened.</p>
<a name="Recursive Deletion Revisited"></a><h2>Recursive Deletion Revisited</h2>
<p>But wait - what happens if the children of a removed object are still referenced 
by&nbsp;other objects?</p>
&nbsp;

<p>Currently db4o does <b>not</b>&nbsp;check whether objects to be deleted are 
referenced anywhere&nbsp;else, so please be very careful when using this 
feature.<br>However it is fairly easy to implement referential checking on 
deletion <br>using ObjectCanDelete callback. See <a href="../../Advanced_db4o_Techniques/Callbacks.html" class="wikiLink">Callbacks chapter</a> <br>for more 
information.<br></p>
