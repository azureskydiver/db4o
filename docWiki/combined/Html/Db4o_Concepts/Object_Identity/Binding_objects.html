        <h1>Binding objects</h1><p></p>

<p>Db4o adds additional flexibility to its reference system allowing the user to re-associate an object with its stored instance or to replace an object in database:</p>


</p>


</p>


</p>

<p>Typical usecases could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../Advanced_Type_Handling/Static_Fields_And_Enums/Static_Fields_And_Enums.html" class="wikiLink">enums and static fields</a></li>
<li>working on objects disconnected from the database</li>
<li>refactoring</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following requirements should be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ID needs to be a valid internal object ID, previously retrieved with ExtObjectContainer#getID(object)</li>
<li>The object parameter needs to be of the same class as the stored object.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Calling ExtObjectContainer#bind(object,id) does not have any impact on persisted objects. It only attaches the new object to the database identity. ObjectContainer#set(object) should be used to persist the change.</p>
<p>Let's look how it works in practice. </p>







<p>So this method gives you control over internal object storage. But its usage is potentially dangerous and normally should be avoided. Use ExtObjectContainer#bind(object,id) only for short-lived objects and in controlled situations where no other references exist.</p></div>
