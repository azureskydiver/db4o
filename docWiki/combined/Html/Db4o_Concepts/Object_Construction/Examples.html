<p>The above class is fine for use with and without callConstructors set.</p>


 </p>
<p>The above C2 class needs to have callConstructors set to true. Otherwise, since transient members are not stored and the constructor code is not executed, toString() will potentially run into a NullPointerException on x.length().</p>


 </p>
<p>The above C3 class needs to have callConstructors set to false (the default), since the (only) constructor will throw a NullPointerException when called with a null value.</p>


 </p>
<p>This class cannot be cleanly reinstantiated by db4o: Both approaches will fail, so one has to resort to configuring a translator.</p></div>
