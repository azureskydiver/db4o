<p>We will save the database to XML file "formula1.xml":</p>

 </p>
<p>After the method executes all car objects from the database will be stored in 
the export file as an array. Note that child objects (Pilot) are stored as well 
without any additional settings. You can check the created XML file to see how

XML file:</p>
