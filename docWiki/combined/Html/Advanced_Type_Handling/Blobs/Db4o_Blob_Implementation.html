        <h1>Db4o Blob Implementation</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Built-in db4o Blob type helps you to get rid of the problems of byte[] array, though it has its own drawbacks. Pros and Cons for the points, mentioned above:</p>

<ol>
<li>
every Blob gets it's own file </li>

<p>+ main database file stays a lot smaller </p>

<p>+ backups are possible over individual files </p>

<p>+ the BLOBs are accessible without db4o</p>

<p>- multiple files need to be managed </p>

<li>C/S communication runs asynchronous in separate thread</li>

<p>+ asynchronous storage allows the main application thread to continue its work, while blobs are being stored </p>

<li>special code is necessary to store and load</li>

<p>
- it is more difficult to move objects between db4o database files</p>

<li>no concerns about activation depth</li>
<p>
+ big objects won't be loaded into memory as part of the activation process</p>
</ol>
<p>Let's look, how it works. </p>

<p>
First, BLOB storage should be defined:</p>

 </p>

 </p>

 </p>

<p>where storageFolder is a String value representing local or server path to store BLOBs. If that value is not defined, db4o will use the default folder "blobs" in user directory.</p>

<p>
We will use a modified Car class, which holds reference to the car photo:</p>





 
</p>

<p>CarImage is a wrapper to BLOB, representing the photo:</p>





 </p>

<p>inFolder ( "blobs\in\") is used as a location of existing files, which are to be stored into db4o, and outFolder ( "blobs\out\") will be the place for images, retrieved from the database.</p>

<p>
readFile method allows blob to be read from the specified location into db4o storage:</p>







<p>As reading is done in a dedicated thread, you can use Blob#getStatus() in a loop to create a progress window.</p>

<p>
The same applies to the write operation, which copies BLOB, stored with db4o, to the specified filesystem location. </p>

<p>Let's store some cars together with their images in our database:</p>






</p>







<p>CarImage is stored in the database just like normal object, no BLOB data is transferred before explicit call (Blob#readFrom in CarImage#readFile method), which copies the images to the storageFolder.</p>

<p>Please, note, that CarImage reference should be set to the database before uploading actual data. To get the images back to the filesystem we can run a usual query:</p>

<p>






<p>and get BLOB data using retrieved Car references:</p>







<p>Retrieved images are placed in CarImage.outFolder ("blobs\out"). </p>

<p>So query interface operates on references - no BLOB data is loaded into memory until explicit call (Blob#writeTo). This also means, that activationDepth does not affect Blob objects and best querying performance is achieved without additional coding.</p></div>
