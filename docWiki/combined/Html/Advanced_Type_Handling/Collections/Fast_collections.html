        <h1>Fast collections</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Db4o's solution for the best collection performance and lowest memory consumption is to implement them directly on top of BTrees without an intermediate "stored-object-db4o" layer (P1Object, P1Collection, P2LinkedList). </p>
<p>This task is still under development, but already it makes sense to be ready to switch to the new fast collections seamlessly.</p>
<p>Current recommendation for collection usage with db4o is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declare members of persistent classes as interface (java.util.List / System.Collections.IList).</li>
<li>Create central factory method to implement concrete collection (can be switched to fast collection implementation easily).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, avoid the following realizations, which will make the switching more difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declaring concrete implementations as fields in persistent classes</li>
<li>Deriving from JDK collection classes</li>
<li>Using third-party non-standard collections</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at application design, which will allow you to upgrade your application to fast collections with the least effort.</p>
<p>In our example we will save a list of pilots as members of one team. To make it simple let's use the following factory class to get the proper list implementation:</p>



<p>The concrete class returned by the CollectionFactory can be changed to any other collection implementation (fast collection) with the minimum coding effort.</p>
<p>We will use the following class as a team of pilots:</p>


 </p>
<p>Let's try to store our team:</p>


 </p>
<p>If we want to update one of the pilots, we will have to retrieve the whole collection:

 </p>
<p>The idea of the new fast collection implementation is to allow select/update of collection elements without an intermediate "stored-object-db4o" layer. This will allow random activation and fast querying, thus providing a considerable performance improvement especially on big collections holding deep object graphs.</p></div>
