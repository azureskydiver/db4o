        <h1>StoredClass and StoredField interfaces</h1>
<p></p>
<p>(IStoredClass and IStoredField in .NET)</p>

<p>Let's look closer at the class meta-information interfaces.</p>
<p>They look quite similar to reflection API, but unlike reflection there is no information about methods and constructors.</p>
<p>You can only use StoredClass to get the class's fields:</p>







<p>
returns all stored fields of this stored class.</p>







<p>
returns an existing stored field of this stored class.</p>
<p>You can also use this interface to explore classes hierarchy.</p>







<p>returns the parent of the class.</p>
<p>
StoredField interface gives you access to various meta-field information, such as field name, field type. It also provides some helpful methods for manipulating fields accepting their object as a variable (see db4o API for more information).</p>
