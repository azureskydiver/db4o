        <h1>Creating your own reflector</h1>
<p></p>

<p>By default db4o uses JdkReflector(Java) or NetReflector (.NET) as a GenericReflector delegate.</p>
<p>
However, the programmer can instruct db4o to use a specially designed reflection implementation:</p>






<p>where reflector is one of the available reflectors or your own reflector implementation. </p>
<p>
At present db4o comes with SelfReflector, which was designed for environments, which do not have built-in support for reflections (J2ME for example). In this implementation all the classes' information is stored in special registry. User classes should implement self_get and self_set methods to be registered individually and become "known" to SelfReflector. </p>
<p>
Specific reflectors can be written for special usecases. </p>
<p>Let's look how to create a reflector. Remember that db4o relies on reflector to read the database, so errors in reflector may prevent your database from opening.</p>
<p>To keep things simple we will write a LoggingReflector, its only difference from standard reflector is that information about loaded classes is outputted to console. All reflectors used by db4o should implement com.db4o.reflect.Reflector interface.</p>





 
</p>

<p>It is easy to see that this reflector provides the same functionality as JdkReflector or NetReflector extended by console output. The following simple test will show how it works:</p>





 </p>

<p>The output can help you to track all the loaded classes. </p>
<p>
Reflection is a powerful tool, which plays a fundamental role in db4o. Understanding reflection will help you to understand the whole db4o functionality in detail. </p></div>
