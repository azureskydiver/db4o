<p>By default db4o does not persist static fields. Normally this is not necessary as static values are set for a class, not for an object. However you can set up db4o to store static fields if you need to implement constant or enumeration:</p>



<p>Do not use this option unnecessarily, as it will slow down the process of opening database files and the stored objects will occupy space in the database file.</p>
<p>This option does not have any eaffect on primitive types (int, boolean, etc). Use their object alternatives instead (Integer, Boolean, etc).</p>
<p>When this setting is on for a specific class, all non-primitive-typed static field values of this class are stored the first time an object of the class is stored, and restored, every time a database file is opened afterwards, after class meta information is loaded for this class (when the class objects are retrieved with a query, for example).</p>
<p>A good example of non-primitive constant type is type-safe enumeration implementation:</p>

<p>Let's use it with </p>






</p>







<p>We can try to save pilots with the default db4o settings:</p>







<p>That does not work however. We will have to explicitly point out, which class's static fields we want to save:</p>



 </p>









<p>As it was mentioned before, it is important to keep static values in one place and do not allow different objects to modify them. If we try to change static value from the referencing object:</p>







<p>the value just does not change.</p>
In order to update static field we will have to do that explicitly:













<p>We can see that the reference has changed correctly. </p>
<p>What about deletion? Nothing is new here. We can delete static fields from the referenced object, or directly from the database:</p>
