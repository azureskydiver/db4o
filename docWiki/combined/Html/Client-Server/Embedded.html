        <h1>Embedded</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the API side, there's no real difference between transactions&nbsp;executing concurrently within the same VM and transactions executed&nbsp;against a remote server. To use concurrent transactions within&nbsp;a single VM, we just open a db4o server on our database file,&nbsp;directing it to run on port 0, thereby declaring that no networking&nbsp;will take place.</p> <br /></p><p>Again, we will delegate opening and closing the server to our&nbsp;environment to focus on client interactions.</p> <br /></p><p>The transaction level in db4o is <em>read committed</em>&nbsp;. However, each&nbsp;client container maintains its own weak reference cache of already known&nbsp;objects. To make all changes committed by other clients immediately, we&nbsp;have to explicitly refresh known objects from the server. We will delegate&nbsp;this task to a specialized version of our listResult() method.</p> <br /></p> <br /></p><p>Simple rollbacks just work as you might expect now.</p> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
