        <h1>Out-of-band Signalling</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes a client needs to send a special message
to a server in order&nbsp;to tell the server to do something.&nbsp;&nbsp;The server
may need to be signalled&nbsp;to perform a defragment or it may need to be
signalled to shut itself&nbsp;down gracefully.<br /><br />This is configured by calling setMessageRecipient(), passing the object&nbsp;that will process client-initiated messages.</p> <br /></p><p>The message is received and processed by a processMessage() method:</p> <br /></p><p>Db4o
allows a client to send an arbitrary signal or message to a server&nbsp;by
sending a plain Java object to the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;The server will receive&nbsp;a
callback message, including the object that came from the client.&nbsp;The
server can interpret this message however it wants.</p> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
