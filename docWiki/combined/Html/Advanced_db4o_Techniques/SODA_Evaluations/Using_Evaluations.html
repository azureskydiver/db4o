<p>For a simple example, let's take a Car class keeping a history of SensorReadout instances in a List member. Now imagine that we wanted to retrieve all cars that have assembled an even number of history entries. A quite contrived and seemingly trivial example, however, it gets us into trouble: Collections are transparent to the query API, it just 'looks through' them at their respective members.</p>

<p>So how can we get this done? Let's implement an Evaluation that expects the objects passed in to be instances of type Car and checks their history size.</p>







<p>To test it, let's add two cars with history sizes of one and two respectively:</p>







<p>and run our evaluation against them:</p>
