        <h1>DescendIntoTranslator</h1><p></p><p>Translator API provides a special way of storing and retrieving objects. In fact the actual class is not stored in the database. Instead the information from that class is stored in a primitive object (object array) and the class is recreated during instantiation or activation.</p><p>Let's look how queries handle translated classes. Diagnostics system will help us to see, what is going on.</p><p>In our example class Car is configured to be saved and retrieved with CarTranslator class. CarTranslator saves only car model information appending it with the production date.</p> <br /></p><p>Let's clean our database and store 2 cars:</p> <br /></p><p>We can check the contents of our database with the following method:</p> <br /></p><p>TranslatorDiagListener is implemented to help us filter only those diagnostic messages, that concern translated classes (filtering diagnostics messages is explained in <a href="Diagnostic_Messages_Filter.html" class="wikiLink">Diagnostic Messages Filter</a> chapter).</p><p>We did not get any diagnostic messages here and the result shows the stored cars with extended model values.</p><p>To test Native Queries we will use the predicate, which retrieves only cars, produced in year 2002:</p> <br /></p> <br /></p><p>A diagnostic message should appear pointing out, that the query is not correct in our case. Let's try&nbsp; to correct it using unoptimized NQ and evaluations.</p> <br /></p><p>We will use simple evaluation to check our cars:</p> <br /></p> <br /></p><p>In both cases we the results are correct. Native Query optimization cannot be used with the translated&nbsp;classes, because the actual values of the translated fields are only known after instantiation and activation. That also means that translated classes can have a considerable impact on database performance and should be used with care.</p></div>
