<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standard listeners can potentially produce quite a lot of&nbsp;messages. By writing your own DiagnosticListener you can filter&nbsp;that information.<br />
<br />
On the stage of application tuning you can be interested in&nbsp;optimizing performance through indexing. Diagnostics can help you with&nbsp;that giving information about queries that are running on&nbsp;un-indexed fields. Having this information you can decide which&nbsp;queries are frequent and heavy and should be indexed, and which&nbsp;have little performance impact and do not need an index. Field&nbsp;indexes dramatically improve query performance but they may&nbsp;considerably reduce storage and update performance. <br />
<br />
In order to get rid of all unnecessary diagnostic information and&nbsp;concentrate on indexes let's create special diagnostic listener:</p>


 <br />
</p>
<p>The following command will install the new listener:</p>


<p>We can check the efficacy of IndexDiagListener using queries from&nbsp;the previous paragraphs:</p>


 <br />
</p>
<p>Potentially this piece of code triggers all the diagnostic objects,&nbsp;but we are getting only index warning messages due to&nbsp;IndexDiagListener.<br />
