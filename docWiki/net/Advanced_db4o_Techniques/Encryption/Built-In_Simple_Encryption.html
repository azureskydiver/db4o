        <h1>Built-In Simple Encryption</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(This functionality is depricated)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other encryption methods built-into db4o, is called simple encryption. To use it, the following two methods have to be called, before a database file is created:</p>
<p><span class="java">Java: <br />
Db4o.configure().encrypt(true); <br />
Db4o.configure().password("yourEncryptionPasswordHere");</span></p>
<p><span class="net">.NET: <br />
Db4o.Configure().Encrypt(true); <br />
Db4o.Configure().Password("yourEncryptionPasswordHere");</span></p>
<p>The security standard of the built-in encryption functionality is not very high, not much more advanced than "substract 5 from every byte". This is great for systems with limited resources, or where the encryption needs to be done as quickly as possible.<br />
