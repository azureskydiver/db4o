        <h1>Built-In Simple Encryption</h1>


<p>(This functionality is depricated)</p>

<p>The other encryption methods built-into db4o, is called simple encryption. To use it, the following two methods have to be called, before a database file is created:</p>



<span class="net"></p>

<p>.NET: </p>

<code>Db4o.Configure().Encrypt(true); 
Db4o.Configure().Password("yourEncryptionPasswordHere");</code>

<p></span>

<p>The security standard of the built-in encryption functionality is not very high, not much more advanced than "substract 5 from every byte". This is great for systems with limited resources, or where the encryption needs to be done as quickly as possible.</p></div>
