        <h1>Commit Frequency</h1><p>Commit time has a major influence on all db4o operations.
Commit is generally a slow operation as it requires physical disk access. The
following example shows how the frequency of commits affects the delete
performance:</p>



<p>The following initial setup is used:</p>



<p>Delete procedures are as follows:</p>





<p>Item class used in this example has depth = 3:</p>

<p>The results on the test computer are:</p>

<p><i>Delete test with
different commit frequency</i></p>

<p><i>Test delete all:</i></p>

<p><i>Store 30000
objects: 2432ms</i></p>

<p><i>Deleted all
objects: 3731ms</i></p>

<p><i>Test delete all
with commit after each 1000 objects:</i></p>

<p><i>Store 30000
objects: 2103ms</i></p>

<p><i>Deleted all objects: 8615ms</i></p>





<p>You can see that the time requires
for deletion increased with the amount of commits. To improve the performance
commit frequency should be kept relatively low,&nbsp;
in the same time it must ensure the integrity of the logical
transactions.<br><br>&nbsp;</p></div>
