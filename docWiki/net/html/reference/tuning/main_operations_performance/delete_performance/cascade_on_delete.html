        <h1>Cascade On Delete</h1><p><br></p><p>If you are using cascadeOnDelete option and explicit deletion
of one object causes cascaded delete on several others, you may expect slower
execution:</p>



<p>Note that in the first part of the test each object
deletion only includes a single object. Therefore, when we delete a 1000
objects the amount of the objects in the database is 1000 less. In the second
part each object deletion will trigger deletion of all field objects
(cascadeOnDelete option), therefore the amount of objects deleted from the
database can be anywhere between 1000 (only lowest level objects) and 3000(all
top level objects with their field objects).</p>
