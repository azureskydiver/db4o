<p><font color="#990000">This topic applies to .NET version only.</font></p>
<p>The easiest way to use Db4oTools is to include it directly into the build process. This will enable you to get a processed assembly immediately after a successful build. If you are using Visual Studio Compact Framework emulator, you will get the processed assembly straight into the emulator.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to enable Db4oTools in VS2005 project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that Db4oTools.exe together with the other libraries from the bin folder in the distribution are accessible to your project.</li>
<li>Open Project Properties page and select "Build Events" tab.</li>
<li>In the "Post-build event command line:" enter the following command:</li>
<ul>
<li>[path_to_Db4oTools_folder]/Db4oTools.exe -cf2-delegates $(TargetPath)</li></ul>
<li>In the "Run the post-build event:" select "On successful build"</li>
<li>Run the build. The resulting assembly will contain all the modifications made by Db4oTools.</li></ul>
<p>An example of this is included in the distribution in src/Db4oTools/Db4oTools.Example folder.</p></div>
