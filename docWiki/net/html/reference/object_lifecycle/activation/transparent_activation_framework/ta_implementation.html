        <h1>TA Implementation</h1>

<p>The basic idea for this initial TA
implementation is very simple: </p>

<ul>
<li>objects
have an activation depth of 0, i.e. by default they are not activated at all;</li>
<li>whenever
a method is called on such an object, the first thing to do before actually
executing the method body is to activate the object to level 1,
i.e. populating its direct members.</li>
</ul>




<p>The basic sequence of actions to get
this scheme to work is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever an object is instantiated
from db4o, the database registers itself with this object. To enable this on
the database level <code>TransparentActivationSupport</code> has to be
registered with the db4o configuration.On the object level an object has to
implement the <code>Activatable/IActivatable</code> interface and provide the according
<code>bind(activator)</code> method. The default implementation of the
bind method will simply store the given <code>activator</code> reference for later use.</li>
<li>All methods that are supposed to
require activated object fields should call <code>activate()/Activate()</code> at the
beginning of the message body. The <code>activate()/Activate()</code> method will check
whether the object is already activated. If this is not the case, it will
request the container to activate the object to level 1 and set the activated
flag accordingly.</li>
</ol>



<p>Please, remember that the current
implementation is subject to change in the next versions.</p></div>
