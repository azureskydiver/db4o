        <h1>Performance Benchmarks</h1>

<p>The best way to evaluate the suitability of db4o for your
next application is to write some performance tests. The Benchmarks part of
reference documentation provides some simple benchmarks on insert, delete,
update and query operations. You can use those tests and adjust them to your
application environment.</p>

<p>To get the best picture of the expected performance, replace the classes used in the benchmark with your own object model classes.&nbsp; Populate the appropriate amount of instances to get the database size you expect and calculate the times of the most frequently used operations. For example, if the primary use of your application is caching, you will be mostly interested in insert performance (The cache might not be ever read after all). If you require rapid access to the data in the database - use query benchmarks to evaluate the general performance.<br></p>

<p>It is also a good idea to run benchmarks on the hardware,
which is going to be used in production. That might be not so critical for
normal desktop application, where the characteristics of the hardware can be
easily improved, i.e. memory added, hard disk drive replaces for a faster one,
etc. But for embedded device a simple memory upgrade can mean a considerable
additional cost (multiplied by the amount of devices used in production).&nbsp; To simplify the decision-making process for
such cases db4o provides a special IO benchmark, which can be configured to
emulate the slower IO operations on an embedded device. For more information
see <a href="../../tuning/io_benchmark_tools.html" class="wikiLink">IO Benchmark Tools</a>.</p>

<p>Other valuable information and tips for fine-tuning and
improving db4o performance for different environments can be found in <a href="../../tuning.html" class="wikiLink">Tuning</a>
chapter. It also reveals the common mistakes that lead to poor performance. </p></div>
