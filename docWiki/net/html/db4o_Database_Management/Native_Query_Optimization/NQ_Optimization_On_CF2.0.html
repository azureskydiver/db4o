        <h1>NQ Optimization On CF2.0</h1>
<span class="net">
<p>Due to some platform limitations, CompactFramework 2.0 users using the more 
convenient delegate based Native Query syntax that want their queries to be 
optimized are required to run the Db4oAdmin.exe command line utility on their 
assemblies prior to deploying them. </p>
<p>
The utility which can be found in 
the /bin folder of this distribution is required because the CompactFramework 
API does not expose any of the delegate metadata needed by the Native Query 
optimizer. The tool works by augmenting the bytecode with the necessary delegate 
metadata and replacing ObjectContainer#Query invocations with 
invocations to a lower level method that makes use of the additional 
information.</p>
<p>
The tool can be easily integrated inside Visual Studio.NET 
2005 as a Post Build tool&nbsp;by following the simple steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right 
click the project you want to enable Native Query optimization for</li>
<li>Select<b>'Properties'</b></li>
<li>In the Properties Page select the<b>'Build 
Events'</b>tab</li>
<li>In the<b>'Post-build event command line'</b>text box insert 
the following text&nbsp;<b>"/bin/Db4oAdmin.exe</b></li>
<li><b>cf2-delegates $(TargetPath)"</b> without the quotes and replacing 
to the correct&nbsp;value for your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete example can be found in the Db4oAdmin.Example directory of the distribution. </p>
