<p>Db4oAdmin.exe can also be used to pre optimize the Native Queries in a given 
assembly. This makes it possible to deploy an application without Db4oTools.dll 
(the assembly where the Native Query runtime optimizer lives) while also 
possibly reducing Native Query execution time by dropping runtime analysis 
completely.</p>
<p>
Execute the Db4oAdmin.exe command line utility without any 
arguments and check out the help information.</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT: the tool is 
still in constant development and it currently&nbsp;does not support pre optimization 
of Native Queries expressed as delegates.</p>
