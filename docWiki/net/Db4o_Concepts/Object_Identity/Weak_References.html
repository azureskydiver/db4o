        <h1>Weak References</h1><p></p><p>Each retrieved or created object is automatically placed into reference system. Of course you&nbsp;have control over it and can purge or deactivate retrieved objects to prevent ever-growing&nbsp;memory consumption. However this requires a lot of attention and coding effort. Luckily, this&nbsp;is not necessary as db4o offers much easier way to manage the memory&nbsp;- WeakReferences. <br />Any object is kept in the memory while application has references to it otherwise it becomes&nbsp;eligible for garbage collection.<br />In the default configuration db4o uses weak references and a dedicated thread to clean them&nbsp;up after objects have been garbage collected by the VM. Weak references need extra&nbsp;resources and the cleanup thread will have a considerable impact on performance since it&nbsp;has to be synchronized with the normal operations within the ObjectContainer. <br /></p></div>
