<p>Db4oAdmin.exe can also be used to pre optimize the Native Queries in a&nbsp;given 
assembly. This makes it possible to deploy an application without&nbsp;Db4oTools.dll 
(the assembly where the Native Query runtime optimizer&nbsp;lives) while also 
possibly reducing Native Query execution time by&nbsp;dropping runtime analysis 
completely.<br />
<br />
Execute the Db4oAdmin.exe command line utility without any 
arguments and check&nbsp;out the help information.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: the tool is 
still in constant development and it currently&nbsp;does not support pre optimization 
of Native Queries expressed as delegates.<br />
