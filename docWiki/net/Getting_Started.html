<a name="Installation"></a><h3>Installation</h3>
<p>If you add one of the above db4o-*.jar files to your CLASSPATH, db4o is installed. In case you work with an integrated development environment like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> (We really recommend Eclipse, it's also free.) you would copy the db4o-*.jar to a /lib/ folder under your project and add db4o to 
your project as a library. (You only need to copy the one jar file for the distribution you are targeting.)</p>

<p>Here is how to add the db4o library to an Eclipse project</p>
<ul>
<li>create a folder named "lib" under your project 
directory, if it doesn't exist yet</li>
<li>copy db4o-*.jar to this folder</li>
<li>Right-click on your project in the Package Explorer and choose "refresh"</li>
<li>Right-click on your project in the Package Explorer again and choose 
"properties"</li>
<li>select "Java Build Path" in the treeview on the left</li>
<li>select the "Libraries" tabpage.</li>
<li>click "Add Jar"</li>
<li>the "lib" folder 
should appear below your project</li>
<li>choose db4o-*.jar in this folder</li>
<li>hit OK twice
</li>
</ul>
