If you deploy db4o within your web application, there&nbsp;should be no problem at all. When used as a shared library db4o has to be configured&nbsp;to use the dedicated web application classloader. This can be done by assigning the&nbsp;classloader of a class that's present in the web application only, or by using the&nbsp;context classloader, since all servlet container implementations we are aware of&nbsp;will set it accordingly.<br /><br />You will find more detailed information on classloader handling in Tomcat, the&nbsp;reference servlet container implementation, here:<br /><br /><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/class-loader-howto.html" target="_blank">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/class-loader-howto.html</a></span><br /></p><a name="Eclipse"></a><h4>Eclipse</h4><p><span>Eclipse uses the system classloader to retrieve its core classes. There is one&nbsp;dedicated classloader per plugin, and the classloader delegation tree will&nbsp;resemble the plugin dependency tree. The context classloader will&nbsp;usually be the system classloader that knows nothing about db4o and your&nbsp;business classes. So the best candidate is the classloader for one of your&nbsp;domain classes within the plugin.<br /></span></p><a name="Running Without Classes"></a><h4><span>Running Without Classes</span></h4><p><span><span>Recently db4o has started to learn to cope with missing class definitions.&nbsp;This is a by-product of the work on our <a href="http://www.db4objects.net/om/" target="_blank"><font color="#555555">object manager application</font></a>. However,&nbsp;this feature is still quite restricted (read-only mode, etc.), incomplete and&nbsp;is under heavy development. If you like to play with this feature and help&nbsp;us with your feedback to enhance it, you are welcome, but we strongly recommend&nbsp;not to try to use this for production code of any kind.</span></span></p></div>
