        <h1>Inheritance hierarchies</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do not create inheritance hierarchies, if you don't need them. <br /><em>Advantage</em><br />Avoiding inheritance hierarchies will help you to get better performance as only actual classes will be kept in the class index and in the database.<br /><em>Effect</em><br />Every class in the hierarchy requires db4o to maintain a class index. It is also true for abstract classes and interfaces since db4o has to be able to run a query against them.<br /><em>Alternate strategies</em><br />Class hierarchies and interfaces may be valuable for your application design. You can also use interface/superclass to query for implementations/subclasses.<br /><br /></p></div>
