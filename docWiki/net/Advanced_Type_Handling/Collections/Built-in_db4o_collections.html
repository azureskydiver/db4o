        <h1>Built-in db4o collections</h1><p></p>
<p>Db4o provides its own built-in collection implementation to improve performance and decrease memory&nbsp;consumption:</p>
<p><span class="java">Java:<br />ObjectContainer.ext().collections.newLinkedList(); <br />
ObjectContainer.ext().collections.newHashMap();<br />
ObjectContainer.ext().collections.newIdentityHashMap(); <br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="net">.NET: <br />ObjectContainer.Ext().Collections.NewLinkedList(); <br />
ObjectContainer.Ext().Collections.NewHashMap();<br />
ObjectContainer.Ext().Collections.NewIdentityHashMap(); <br />
</span></p>

<br />
The LinkedList implementation only holds the first and the last elements in RAM, all the other objects are&nbsp;loaded on demand. Apparently, this implementation provides good performance for sequential&nbsp;traversal, but it is still quite inefficient for random selection/update. <br />
The HashMap implementation only holds an array of hash values in RAM and loads keys and objects on&nbsp;demand. <br />
Db4o collections also provide the following functionality to help the programmer produce expected results&nbsp;with as little work as possible:<br />
- Newly added objects are automatically persisted.<br />
- Collection elements are automatically activated, when they are needed. The activation depth is&nbsp;configurable with<em>Db4oCollection#activationDepth(int)</em><br />
- Removed objects can be deleted automatically, if the list is configured with&nbsp;<em>Db4oCollection#deleteRemoved(boolean)</em><br />
Weak Reference system ensures that objects are freed from RAM, as soon as there are no references&nbsp;to them.<br />
These implementations can be faster for some cases and slower for others.<br /><style>
