        <h1>Classloader issues</h1><p></p><span class="java"><p>Db4o needs to know its own classes, of course, and it needs to know the class definitions of the objects it stores. (In Client/Server mode, both the server and the clients need access to the class definitions.) While this usually is a non-issue with self-contained standalone applications, it can become tricky to ensure this condition when working with plugin frameworks, where one might want to deploy db4o as a shared library for multiple plugins, for example.</p><p></span> <br></p><style>
