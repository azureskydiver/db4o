        <h1>Custom Encryption Adapters</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>db4o still provides a solution for high-security encryption by allowing any user to choose his own encryption mechanism that he thinks he needs. The db4o file IO mechanism is pluggable and any fixed-length encryption mechanism can be added. All that needs to be done is to write an IoAdapter plugin for db4o file IO.<br />
<br />
This is a lot easier than it sounds. Simply:<br />
- take the sources of com.db4o.io.RandomAccessFileAdapter as an example<br />
- write your own IoAdapter implementation that delegates raw file access to another adapter using the GoF decorator pattern.<br />
- Implement the #read() and #write() methods to encrypt and decrypt when bytes are being exchanged with the file<br />
- plug your adapter into db4o with the following method:</p>
<p><span class="java">Java: Db4o.configure().io(new MyEncryptionAdapter()); </span><br /></p>
<p><span class="net">.NET: Db4o.Configure().Io(new MyEncryptionAdapter()); </span><br /></p>
However, you'll have to keep in mind that db4o will write partial udates. For example, it may write a full object and then only modify one field entry later one. Therefore it is not sufficient to en-/decrypt each access in isolation. You'll rather have to make up a tiling structure that defines the data chunks that have to be en-/decrypted together.<br />
<br />
Another method to inject encryption capabilities into db4o for instances of specific classes only is to implement and configure an en-/decrypting translator.<br /><style>
