<P>Thanks for visiting the new db4o reference documentation. For navigation, use the links located within the topic body, or below the body on most topics. In online version you can also use the navigation located in the "bread-crumbs" above this topic. (just below the navigation bar). In offline version a navigation frame is provided on the left.</P>
<P>This reference is for anyone who is using or is going to use db4o and wants to have handy and thorough information about it.</P>
<P>The reference is offered for Java, .NET and mono environments, providing examples in java, Visual Basic and c#. Note that most of the examples are console applications except for those clearly mentioning the environment (web-applications, windows forms etc.). Online version goes with filters on the right pane, which can help you to concentrate on the requested content.</P>
<P>The information is presented in topics sets; each of them is atomic and can be used in arbitrary order according to your current needs. The same applies to the code examples which can be downloaded and tested in your environment. (Note for Java users - the examples are JDK5 compatible.)</P></div>
