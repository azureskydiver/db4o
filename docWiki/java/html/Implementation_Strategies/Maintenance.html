        <h1>Maintenance</h1><p>db4o is designed to
minimize maintenance tasks to the absolute minimum. The stored class
schema adapts to the application automatically as it is being
developed. db4o "understands" the addition and removal of fields which
allows it to continue to work against modified classes without having
to reorganize the database file. Internally db4o works with a superset
of all class versions previously used.</p>
<p>However there are two recommended maintenance tasks, that can both
be fully automated remotely with API calls. They will be reviewed in
the following chapters.</p><p><div class="childTopicList">More Reading:<ul>
