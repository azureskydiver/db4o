        <h1>Scalability</h1>

<p>Db4o can potentially be used for
rather large databases - up to 254 GB per database file. One of the biggest
benefits is that db4o query performance does not decrease with the growth of
the database file. However it can be affected by the amount of the same type
objects in the database. </p>

<p>If you want to make sure that your
application can grow and scale with db4o database you may take the following
steps:</p>

<ul><li>Write performance tests to accommodate for performance requirements
     of the growing application</li><li>Use database clusters to spread the load between several
     database files.</li><li>Use client-server version to enable many clients using
     data at the same time</li><li>Use in-memory database to improve performance</li></ul>

<p>Another important factor for performance and scalability is
fragmentation. That is why it is important to run db4o <a href="../../tuning/performance_hints/defragment.html" class="wikiLink">Defragment</a>
regularly. The physical disk fragmentation also plays an important role, so
disk defragment should be also scheduled on a regular basis to improve the
performance.</p></div>
