        <h1>Concurrency Control In Db4o</h1>

<p>Db4o
uses overly optimistic concurrency control: an object is locked for read and
write, but no collision detection is used. In the same time, db4o provides you
with all means to implement a suitable for you concurrency control strategy in
your application.<br></p><p>In a client-server environment each client obtains a
transaction from a client transaction pool. The changes are written to a
temporary transactional space, which can be committed/rolled back when a
commit/rollback message is received from the client.</p>

<p>When a client object container needs to write (or read)
something a message with the task is created. If the batchMessages
configuration setting is set to true, the messages will be collected in a batch
of certain size before being sent to the server. The client write message
process is synchronized, i.e. the only one client process can write to the
server socket at a time.</p>

<p>On the server a message dispatcher loop gets messages from
the socket and processes them depending on the type of message.</p>

<p>When a client transaction is committed a lock on the
database file is obtained for physical write of data. The other client
transactions have to wait till the write is done. To notify the other clients
about the changes made by the current client commit <a href="../../implementation_strategies/callbacks/commit-time_callbacks.html" class="wikiLink">Commit-Time Callbacks</a>
are used</p>
