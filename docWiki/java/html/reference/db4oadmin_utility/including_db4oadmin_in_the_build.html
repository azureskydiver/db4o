        <h1>Including Db4oAdmin In The Build</h1>
<P><FONT color=#990000>This topic applies to .NET version only.</FONT></P>
<P>The easiest way to use Db4oAdmin is to include it directly into the build process. This will enable you to get a processed assembly immediately after a successful build. If you are using Visual Studio Compact Framework emulator, you will get the processed assembly straight into the emulator.</P>
<P>Use the following steps to enable Db4oAdmin in VS2005 project:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Make sure that Db4oAdmin.exe together with the other libraries from the bin folder in the distribution are accessible to your project.</LI>
<LI>Open Project Properties page and select "Build Events" tab.</LI>
<LI>In the "Post-build event command line:" enter the following command:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>[path_to_Db4oAdmin_folder]/Db4oAdmin.exe -cf2-delegates $(TargetPath)</LI></UL>
<LI>In the "Run the post-build event:" select "On successful build"</LI>
<LI>Run the build. The resulting assembly will contain all the modifications made by Db4oAdmin.</LI></UL>
<P>An example of this is included in the distribution in src/Db4oAdmin/Db4oAdmin.Example folder.</P></div>
