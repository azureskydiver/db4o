        <h1>Referential Integrity</h1><p>Db4o does not have a built-in referential integrity checking
mechanism. Luckily EventRegistry gives you access to all the necessary events
to implement it. You will just need to trigger validation on create, update or
delete and cancel the action if the integrity is going to be broken.</p>

<p>For example, if Car object is referencing Pilot and the
referenced object should exist, this can be ensured with the following handler
in deleting() event:</p>

<span name="cs_wiki_filter" csw_filters="java">

<div class="AttachmentInfo">Code attachment not found: /Resources/Reference/Implementation_Strategies/Callbacks/Possible_Usecases/CallbacksJava.Zip</div>

</span>




You can also add handlers for creating() and updating()
events for a Car object to make sure that the pilot field is not null.&nbsp;
