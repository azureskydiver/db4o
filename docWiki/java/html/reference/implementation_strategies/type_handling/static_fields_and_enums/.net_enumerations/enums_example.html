        <h1>Enums Example</h1><p> <br></p>
<p>Let's look at the following Enum and class with Enum field:</p>





<p>Now store an open and closed door to the database:</p>





<p>Let's check how different types of queries work:</p>





<p>You can see that SODA
and LINQ queries return the correct results. Query By Example has the
<a href="../../../../object_lifecycle/querying/query_by_example/qbe_limitations.html" class="wikiLink">limitations</a> with the 0 value as it is considered to be a null template and
returns all values.</p>

<p>Let's see how many enum objects did we save in the database:</p>





<p>Well, it's zero - which means that enums don't have database
identity and are only stored as part of their parent object.</p></div>
