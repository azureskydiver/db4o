        <h1>Querying</h1>
<p>It is easy to
retrieve all of the Pilot instances from the database: just right-click the
Pilot class in db4o Browser and select "View All Objects". The list of the
Pilot objects will be shown in the Query Result view:</p>

<p><img src="OME_Result.Jpg"/></p>

<p>You can see object details in the detailed view
below. Try to change any values and use Save button to persist the changes to
the database. You can also use Delete button to delete objects from the
database. For the objects containing field objects you will be prompted to use
cascade on delete.</p>

<p>More
complex queries can be done by using Build Query view:</p>

<p><img src="OME_Query.Jpg"/></p>

<p>Drag
"points" field from the db4oBrowser view into the Build Query view, set
condition "Greater Than", put a value "99" and run the query. You can return to
the Built Query tab and modify the query later on again. For example: add "AND"
operator, drag "name" field and set the value to "Michael Schumacher". Re-run
the query. </p>

<p>When the
new query is created, the previous query is stored and can be selected from the
history drop-down:</p>

<p><img src="OME_QHistory.Jpg"/></p>

<p>More
sophisticated queries can be build by joining grouped constraints using "Add
Group" button.</p>

<p>When you
are done working with the database in OME, you can close the connection by
using OME-&gt;Connect/Disconnect DB menu command or by using the equivalent
button on the toolbar. </p></div>
