<P>Sometimes you will need your client to update many objects in a similar way on the server. The&nbsp;solution that is sought in this case is to give a server a criteria for selecting objects and&nbsp;instructions on what to do with them. In this way you will avoid the overhead of getting the objects&nbsp;over network and sending the updated set back.<BR></P></div>
