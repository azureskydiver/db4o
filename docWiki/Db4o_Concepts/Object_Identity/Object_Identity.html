        <h1>Object Identity</h1><p></p><p>Db4o keeps references to all persistent objects that are currently held in RAM, whether they&nbsp;were retrieved, created or activated in this session. The main role of the reference system&nbsp;is to provide access to the required data with the best speed and lowest memory consumption.&nbsp;Performance and usability of the reference system depend much on how the system manages&nbsp;objects identities.</p></div>
