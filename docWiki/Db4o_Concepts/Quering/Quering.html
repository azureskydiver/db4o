<P>db4o supplies three querying systems, Query-By-Example (QBE)&nbsp;Native Queries (NQ), and the SODA API. <BR><BR>Query-By-Example (QBE) is appropriate as a quick start for users&nbsp;who are still acclimating to storing and retrieving objects with db4o,&nbsp;but they are quite restrictive in functionality.<BR><BR>Native Queries (NQ) are the main db4o query interface, recommended&nbsp;for general use.<BR><BR>SODA is the underlying internal API. It is provided for backward&nbsp;compatibility and it can be useful for dynamic generation&nbsp;of queries, where NQ are too strongly typed. There may be queries&nbsp;that will execute faster in SODA style, so it can be used to tune applications.<BR><BR>Of course you can mix these strategies as needed.<BR></P></div>
