- jar instrumentation support
- exception handling
- use file-based filtering instead of IClassFile for incremental build
- notify PDE about changed class files
- export configuration for use by ant build
- when adding nature, all classes will be instrumented by default?

- distribute package selection dialog responsibilities between model and property page

- restrict nature applicability to IJavaProject natures
- recursive filtering vs single package filtering
- beautify log view

- non-headless tests (log view) :/
- port test project infrastructure to scala
