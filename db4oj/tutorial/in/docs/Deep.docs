.0 Deep graphs ..

We have already seen how db4o handles object ._
associations, but our running example is still quite flat and ._
simple, compared to real-world domain models. In particular we ._
haven't seen how db4o behaves in the presence of recursive ._
structures. We will emulate such a structure by replacing our ._
history list with a linked list implicitely provided by the ._
SensorReadout class.

Our car only maintains an association to a 'head' sensor readout ._
now.

.1 Storing and updating ..

No surprises here.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#storeCar -out ..

Now we would like to build a sensor readout chain. We already know ._
about the update depth trap, so we configure this first.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#setCascadeOnUpdate -out ..

Let's collect a few sensor readouts.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#takeManySnapshots -out ..

.1 Retrieving ..

Now that we have a sufficiently deep structure, we'll retrieve it ._
from the database and traverse it.

First let's verify that we indeed have taken lots of snapshots.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#retrieveAllSnapshots ..

All these readouts belong to one linked list, so we should be able to access ._
them all by just traversing our list structure.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#retrieveSnapshotsSequentially ..

Ouch! What's happening here?

.2 Activation depth ..

Deja vu - this is just the other side of the update depth issue.

db4o cannot track when you are traversing references from objects ._
retrieved from the database. So it would always have to return ._
'complete' object graphs on retrieval - in the worst case this would ._
boil down to pulling the whole database content into memory for a single ._
query.

This is absolutely undesirable in most situations, so ._
db4o provides a mechanism to give the client fine-grained control ._
over how much he wants to pull out of the database when asking for ._
an object. This mechanism is called  .i activation depth .. and works ._
quite similar to our familiar update depth.

The default activation depth for any object is 5, so our example above ._
runs into nulls after traversing 5 references.

We can dynamically ask objects to activate their member references. This ._
allows us to retrieve each single sensor readout in the list from ._
the database just as needed.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#retrieveSnapshotsSequentiallyImproved ..

Note that 'cut' references may also influence the behavior of your ._
objects: In this case the length of the list is calculated dynamically, ._
and therefor constrained by activation depth.

Instead of dynamically activating subgraph elements, you can configure ._
activation depth statically, too. We can tell our SensorReadout class ._
objects to cascade activation automatically, for example.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#setActivationDepth ..

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#retrieveSnapshotsSequentially ..

You have to be very careful, though. Activation issues are tricky. Db4o ._
provides a wide range of configuration features to control activation ._
depth at a very fine-grained level. You'll find those triggers in ._
com.db4o.config.Configuration and the associated ObjectClass and ._
ObjectField classes.

Don't forget to clean up the database.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter5.DeepExample#deleteAllObjects ..

.1 Conclusion ..

Now we should have the tools at hand to work with arbitrarily complex ._
object graphs. But so far we have only been working forward, hoping that ._
the changes we apply to our precious data pool are correct. What if we ._
have to roll back to a previous state due to some failure? In the ._
.l Transactions next chapter ..l  we will introduce the db4o transaction concept.
