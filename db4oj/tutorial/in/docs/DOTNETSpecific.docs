.1 Enums

When dealing with .NET enumerated types we must face the fact ._
that they are nothing more than glorified integer numbers. In other ._
words, everything we know about how db4o handles integer values ._
also applies to .NET enumerated types: ._
it does not make sense to store, delete or retrieve enumerated values ._
directly but to always use them as fields of other types.

A very important implication of this similarity that might not be entirely ._
obvious is in how db4o will handle enumerated values during a Query By Example. ._
Let's consider the following (WRONG) example:

.c enum DoorState {
  Open,
  Closed
}

class Door { 
  DoorState _state;
  public Door(DoorState state) {
    _state = state;
  }
}

class Example {
  public static ObjectSet FindOpenDoors(ObjectContainer container) {
    return container.get(new Door(DoorState.Open));
  }
}
..
The problem is in how the method FindOpenDoors tries to use the enumerated ._
value DoorState.Open to retrieve only the specified subset of Door objects ._
when the query in fact will return ALL Door instances regardless of their _state ._
field value.

This might seem intriguing at first but it's just a matter of ._
understanding two things:

1) QBE works by looking at the given prototype and filtering the system ._
by only those fields which are not set to their default/null/zero value ._
according to its underlying type;

2) the DoorState enum declaration in our first example really means:
.c enum DoorState {
  Open = 0,
  Closed = 1
}
.. which implies that DoorState.Open is the default value for the DoorState type ._
thus excluding it from the filter.

There are two main strategies to cope with this situation:

1) to use the SODA API and recode the Example class as:
.c class Example {
  public static ObjectSet FindOpenDoors(ObjectContainer container) {
    Query query = container.query();
    query.constrain(typeof(Door));
    query.descend("_state").constrain(DoorState.Open);
    return query.execute();
  }
}
..
2) to always reserve the first slot of an enumerate value by either ._
explicitly naming it:
.c enum DoorState {
  Uninitialized,
  Open,
  Closed
}
.. or explicitly setting the value of every element:
.c enum DoorState {
  Open = 1,
  Closed = 2
}
..
