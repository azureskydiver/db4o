Tuning suggestions:
- cache class ids separately -done- (+)
- optimize BTreeRange#lastPointer() -done- (+)
- use single key plus handler instead of values -done- (+++)
- only map addresses for objects whose class is covered by a string index -partially done- (++)
- batch pointer allocation in first pass -done- (o)
- merge id and seen trees - but seen has to be updated per pass...
- increase node size?
- pre-sort classes and use object header class id entry to decide 'seen'?
