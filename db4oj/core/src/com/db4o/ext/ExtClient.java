	 * This method can be used to switch between database files from the client

	 * current one.
	 * <br><br>
	 * If the database file does not exist on the server, it will be created.
	 * <br><br>
	 * A typical usecase:<br>
	 * The main database file is used for login, user and rights management only.
	 * Only one single db4o server session needs to be run. Multiple satellite
	 * database files are used for different applications or multiple user circles.
	 * Storing the data to multiple database files has the following advantages:<br>
	 * - easier rights management<br>
	 * - easier backup<br>
	 * - possible later load balancing to multiple servers<br>
	 * - better performance of smaller individual database files<br>
	 * - special debugging database files can be used
	 * <br><br>
	 * User authorization to the alternative database file will not be checked.

	 * are discarded during the switching process.<br><br>
