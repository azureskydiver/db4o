 * An ObjectSet is a representation for a set of objects returned  by a query.

 * Note that the underlying
 * {@link ObjectContainer ObjectContainer} of an ObjectSet
 * needs to remain open as long as an ObjectSet is used. This is necessary
 * for lazy instantiation. The objects in an ObjectSet are only instantiated
 * when they are actually being used by the application.
