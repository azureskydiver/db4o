.1 Translators ..

In the last chapter we have covered the alternative configurations ._
db4o offers for object reinstantiation. What's left to see is how ._
we can store objects of a class that can't be cleanly stored with either ._
of these approaches.

.2 An example class ..

For this example we'll be using a hypothetical LocalizedItemList class ._
which binds together culture information with a list of items.

System.Globalization.CultureInfo is particularly interesting because it ._
internally holds a native pointer to a system structure which in turn cannot ._
be cleanly stored by db4o.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.evaluation.LocalizedItemList ..

We'll be using this code to store and retrieve and instance of this ._
class with different configuration settings:

.s com.db4odoc.f1.evaluation.TranslatorExample#tryStoreAndRetrieve -run +{} ..

.3 Using the constructor ..

.s com.db4odoc.f1.evaluation.TranslatorExample#tryStoreWithCallConstructors ..

At storage time, db4o tests the only available constructor with null arguments and ._
runs into a NullPointerException, so it refuses to accept our object.

(Note that this test only occurs when configured with exceptionsOnNotStorable - ._
otherwise db4o will silently fail when trying to reinstantiate the object.)

.3 Bypassing the constructor ..

.s com.db4odoc.f1.evaluation.TranslatorExample#tryStoreWithoutCallConstructors -run ..

This still does not work for our case because the native pointer will definetely ._
be invalid. In fact this example crashes the Common Language Runtime.

.2 The Translator API ..

So how do we get our object into the database, now that everything seems ._
to fail? Db4o provides a way to specify a custom way of storing and retrieving ._
objects through the ObjectTranslator and ObjectConstructor interfaces.

.3 ObjectTranslator ..

The ObjectTranslator API looks like this:

.c public Object onStore(ObjectContainer container,
                      Object applicationObject);
public void onActivate(ObjectContainer container,
                       Object applicationObject,
                       Object storedObject);
public Class storedClass ();
..c

The usage is quite simple: When a translator is configured for a class, ._
db4o will call its onStore method with a reference to the database and ._
the instance to be stored as a parameter and will store the object returned. ._
This object's type has to be primitive from a db4o point of view and it has ._
to match the type specification returned by storedClass().

On retrieval, db4o will create a blank object of the target class (using ._
the configured instantiation method) and then pass it on to onActivate() ._
along with the stored object to be set up accordingly.

.3 ObjectConstructor ..

However, this will only work if the application object's class provides ._
some way to recreate its state from the information contained ._
in the stored object, which is not the case for CultureInfo.

For these cases db4o provides an extension to the ObjectTranslator ._
interface, ObjectConstructor, which declares one additional method:

.c public Object onInstantiate(ObjectContainer container,
                            Object storedObject);
..c

If db4o detects a configured translator to be an ObjectConstructor ._
implementation, it will pass the stored class instance to the onInstantiate() ._
method and use the result as a blank application object to be processed ._
by onActivate().

Note that, while in general configured translators are applied to ._
subclasses, too, ObjectConstructor application object instantiation ._
will not be used for subclasses (which wouldn't make much sense, ._
anyway), so ObjectConstructors have to be configured for the ._
concrete classes.

.2 A translator implementation ..

To translate CultureInfo instances, we will store only their name ._
since this is enough to recreate them later. Note that we don't ._
have to do any work in onActivate(), since ._
object reinstantiation is already fully completed in onInstantiate().

.s com.db4odoc.f1.evaluation.CultureInfoTranslator ..

Let's try it out:

.s com.db4odoc.f1.evaluation.TranslatorExample#storeWithTranslator ..

.2 Conclusion ..

For classes that cannot cleanly be stored and retrieved with db4o's ._
standard object instantiation mechanisms, db4o provides an API to ._
specify custom reinstantiation strategies. These also come in two ._
flavors: ObjectTranslators let you reconfigure the state of a 'blank' ._
application object reinstantiated by db4o, ObjectConstructors also ._
take care of instantiating the application object itself.
