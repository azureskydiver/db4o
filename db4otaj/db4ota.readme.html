        The code you find in the db4ota and db4otaj source modules and/or in the db4ota
        jar provide the basis for an implementation of transparent activation for db4o.
        This is just a minimalist first step. To fill in the gaps and to guide further development,
        we depend on your feedback. Please report issues and post proposals or other comments
        in the db4o Product Developer Forum at http://developer.db4o.com/
    </p>
    <h2>
        1. Transparent Activation
    </h2>
    <p>
        db4o currently relies on the developer to explicitly take care of the activation
        depth of his/her persistent object graphs, either by programmatic activation, or
        by configuration. (If you are not familiar with the term "activation" in the context
        of db4o, please refer to the db4o reference documentation.) Transparent activation
        is meant to relieve the developer from this burden by activating objects under the
        hood as needed by the client application.
    </p>
    <h2>
        2. API, hooks and creating TA aware classes
    </h2>
    <p>
        For a description of the current approach and API, please refer to the API documentation
        for com.db4o.ta.Activatable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a more detailed code example, please refer to the minimalist Project class model
        in db4ota/test. The code demonstrates what is required to manually create TA aware
        classes. Everything TA specific is annotated with comments. Please note that the
        PagedList class is just an example for a TA aware collection class - it is not likely
        to become part of the official API, but there will be other, official TA aware collection
        implementations.
    </p>
    <h2>
        3. Injecting TA awareness via bytecode instrumentation
    </h2>
    <p>
        An alternative to requiring developers to manually implement TA aware classes is
        to inject TA awareness in their original, "unaware" code. In our scenario this basically
        means: Generate the Activatable interface declaration, the bind(Activator) method
        implementation, a field to keep a reference to the corresponding Activator instance,
        and the activate() call at the beginning of every method. This is accomplished via
        a classloader that injects this code into the persistent classes when they are loaded.
        (Currently persistent classes have to be "tagged" by providing an appropriate ClassFilter
        instance.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Please refer to RunTASampleInstrumented in the db4otaj/test module for an example
        of the (currently somewhat complicated) setup of the instrumenting classloader.
        Please note that, in addition to this classloading wrapper, db4o also explicitly
        needs to be configured to use the (instrumenting) classloader of the persistent
        classes, as shown in TransparentActivationSampleMain in the same package.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even more than the basic API/implementation conventions, the instrumentation API/configuration
        will be subject to changes. In particular, we will provide a unified framework for
        any kind of bytecode instrumentation, with plugins for features like Native Queries
        and Transparent Activation, including a generic wrapper for starting applications
        with instrumentation support.
    </p>
    <p>
        More detailed documentation on the current status of TA and instrumentation API
        and implementation can be found here: <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/Resources/view.aspx/Reference/Object_Lifecycle/Activation/Transparent_Activation_Framework">

    </p>
    <h2>
        4. Open Issues
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of the most serious issue with this approach is that it doesn't cover direct
        field access from the outside - this scenario could not be handled from within the
        persistent classes exclusively, it would rather be the clients accessing those fields
        that would have to take responsibility for correct activation upon field access.
    </p>
    <h2>
        5. Future development
    </h2>
    <p>
        As already mentioned at the beginning of this text, future development will mainly
        be driven by you - please provide feedback! The following is a (certainly non-exhaustive)
        ad hoc list of possible additions, features and modifications.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>More convenient configuration for TA support </li>
        <li>More performant registry for activatable objects </li>
        <li>Performant TA aware collection implementation(s) </li>
        <li>Drop-in replacement of default platform collections for TA aware custom implementations
        </li>
        <li>Instrumentation of default platform classes </li>
        <li>Unified bytecode instrumentation framework </li>
        <li>Partial activation </li>
        <li>Fine-grained configuration for TA strategies </li>
        <li>Handle external access to fields </li>
