.0 Inheritance ..

So far we have always been working with the concrete (i.e. most ._
specific type of an object. What about subclassing and interfaces?

To explore this, we will differentiate between different kinds of ._
sensors.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter4.PressureSensorReadout ..

Our car's snapshot mechanism is changed accordingly.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter4.Car ..

.1 Storing ..

Our setup code has not changed at all, just the internal workings of a snapshot.

.1 Retrieving ..

db4o will provide us with all objects of the given type. To collect ._
all instances of a given class, no matter whether they are subclass ._
members or direct instances, we just provide a corresponding prototype.

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter4.InheritanceExample#retrieveAllSensorReadoutsQBE ..

This is one more situation where QBE might not be applicable: What if ._
the given type is an interface or an abstract class? Well, there's a little ._
trick to keep in mind:  .? java Class ..? .? net Type ..? .? mono Type ..?  ._
objects receive special handling with QBE.

And of course there's our SODA API:

.1 Updating and deleting ..

...is just the same for all objects, no matter where they are situated ._
in the inheritance tree.

Just like we retrieved all objects from the database above, we can ._
delete all stored objects to prepare for the next chapter.

.1 Conclusion ..

Now we have covered all basic OO features and the way they are handled by ._
db4o. To learn about complex recursive structures and deep objects graphs,._
