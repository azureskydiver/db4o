.1 Query by Example (QBE) ..

When using  .i Query By Example ..  (QBE) you provide db4o with a ._
template object. db4o will return all of the objects which match all ._
non-default field values. This is done via reflecting all of the fields ._
and building a query expression where all non-default-value fields are ._
combined with AND expressions. Here's an example from the previous chapter:

.s com.db4o.f1.chapter1.FirstStepsExample#retrievePilotByName -run ..

Querying this way has some obvious limitations:
- db4o must reflect all members of your example object.
- You cannot perform advanced query expressions. (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- You cannot constrain on values like 0 (integers), "" (empty strings), ._
or nulls (reference types) because they would be interpreted as unconstrained.
- You need to be able to create objects without initialized fields. ._
That means you can not initialize fields where they are declared. ._
You can not enforce contracts that objects of a class are only ._
allowed in a well-defined initialized state.
- You need a constructor to create objects without initialized fields.

To get around all of these constraints, db4o provides the Native Query (NQ) system.
