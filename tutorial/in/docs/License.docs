.1 Opensource Compatibility license (dOCL) ..
The db4o Opensource Compatibility License (dOCL) is designed for free/open ._
source projects that want to embed db4o but do not want to (or are not able to) ._
license their derivative work under the GPL in its entirety. This initiative aims to ._
proliferate db4o into many more open source projects by providing compatibility ._
for projects licensed under Apache, LGPL, BSD, EPL, and others, as required by our users.
The terms of this license are available here:  .l http://www.db4o.com/about/company/legalpolicies/docl.aspx  "dOCL" agreement.  ..

available under a commercial license.
