immediately:

- fix mixed comparison problem: cand.floatVal<12.3d (cand.floatVal<1i work is ok)
  (regression testMixedFieldComparisons)
- fix member field vs. candidate getter bug: this.foo!=data.getBar()
  (expr testFloatMemberFieldNotEqualsComp)
- much more false positive tests

later:

- SODA conversion: <= to smaller().equals() instead of greater.not()?
- How to handle virtual methods? Move optimization from load time
  to query execution time?
- Is there a pattern to make the visitor based code more readable
  (and maintable) in terms of a 'grammar' or the like?
- What (heuristic?) algorithms are there to produce a minimal normal
  form for a boolean expression tree?
- Implement sensible handling for locale variable passing.
- Controlled error handling.
- Check POJQ, Rodrigo's paper,...
- Bloat tests with hard-wired flow graphs?
