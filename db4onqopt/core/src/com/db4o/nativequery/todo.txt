immediately:

- non-candidate method calls in expression tree
- string comparisons
- spike at optimizing comparator
- much more false positive tests

later:

- How to handle virtual methods? Move optimization from load time
  to query execution time?
- Is there a pattern to make the visitor based code more readable
  (and maintable) in terms of a 'grammar' or the like?
- Implement sensible handling for locale variable passing.
- Controlled error handling.
- Bloat tests with hard-wired flow graphs?
