    <h2>
        &nbsp;Getting Started
    </h2>
    <br />
    For the fastest start with db4o please work through the tutorial, available in different
    formats in the following folder:
    <br />
    ./doc/tutorial/
    <br />
    If you are working with db4o for Java, it is recommended to use the interactive
    HTML tutorial:
    <br />
    ./doc/tutorial/index.html
    <br />
    If you are working with db4o for .NET, it is recommended to run the tutorial program:
    <br />
    ./doc/tutorial/Db4objects.Db4o.Tutorial.exe
    <br />
    The PDF tutorial will work best for fulltext search:
    <br />
    ./doc/tutorial/db4o-X.x-tutorial.pdf
    <br />
    <br />
