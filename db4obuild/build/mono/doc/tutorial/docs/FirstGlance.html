<br>
<ul>
<a name="outline310"></a><br><h2>1.1. The db4o engine...</h2>The db4o object database engine consists of one single DLL.&nbsp;This is all that you need to program against. The version&nbsp;supplied with the distribution can be found in /usr/lib/db4o/.	<br>
<br>
<a name="outline311"></a><br><h2>1.2. Installation</h2>To use db4o in a development project, you only need to add one&nbsp;of the above db4o.dll files to your project references.<br>
<br>
Here is how to do this if you are using MonoDevelop:<br>
- Right-click on "References" in the Solution Tab<br>
- choose "Edit References"<br>
- select the ".NET Assembly" tab and then "Browse"<br>
- select /usr/lib/db4o/db4o.dll<br>
- click "Open"<br>
- click "OK"<br>
<br>
<a name="outline312"></a><br><h2>1.3. API</h2>The API documentation for db4o is supplied as a set of HTML pages in <br>
/usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/api/index.html. While you read through this&nbsp;tutorial, it may be helpful to look into the API documentation occasionaly.&nbsp;For the start, the namespaces com.db4o and com.db4o.query are&nbsp;all that you need to worry about.<br>
<br>
Let's take a first brief look at one of the most important interfaces:<br>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td class="lg">
<code><br>
com.db4o.ObjectContainer<br>
</code></td></tr></table>
<br>
This will be your view of a db4o database:<br>
- An ObjectContainer can either be a database in single-user mode or&nbsp;a client to a db4o server.<br>
- Every ObjectContainer owns one transaction. All work is transactional.&nbsp;When you open an ObjectContainer, you are in a transaction, when you&nbsp;commit() or rollback(), the next transaction is started immediately.<br>
- Every ObjectContainer maintains it's own references to stored and&nbsp;instantiated objects. In doing so, it manages object identities.<br>
<br>
In case you wonder why you only see very few methods in an ObjectContainer,&nbsp;here is why: The db4o interface is supplied in two steps in two namespaces,&nbsp;com.db4o and com.db4o.ext for the following reasons:<br>
- It's easier to get started, because the important methods are emphasized.<br>
- It will be easier for other products to copy the basic db4o interface.<br>
- We hint how a very-light-version of db4o should look like.<br>
<br>
Every com.db4o.ObjectContainer object also always is a&nbsp;com.db4o.ext.ExtObjectContainer. You can cast to ExtObjectContainer or you&nbsp;can call the #ext() method if you want to use advanced features.<br>
