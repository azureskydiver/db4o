Getting Started
----------------------------------

If you have installed db4o using the RPM, you will find db4o
files in your documentation and library folders on your machine.

Depending on your Linux distribution, these folders may differ.
Let's assume SuSE for the following:

For the fastest start with db4o please work through the tutorial, 
available in different formats in the following folder:
/usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/tutorial/

The HTML tutorial will get you the best overview:
/usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/tutorial/index.html

The PDF tutorial will work best for fulltext search:
/usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/tutorial/db4o-X.x-tutorial.pdf

The db4o engine is one single .dll library for Mono. You should
find it here:
/usr/lib/db4o/db4o.dll

In this folder you will also find the complete db4o regression
tests. It is recommended to run them on your machine, to help
detect possible problems with your Mono installation:
cd /usr/lib/db4o
mono db4o-mono-test.exe
