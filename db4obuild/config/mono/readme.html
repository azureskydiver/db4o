    <h2>
        &nbsp;Getting Started
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you have installed db4o using the RPM, you will find db4o files in your documentation
        and library folders on your machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on your Linux distribution, these folders may differ. Let's assume SuSE
        for the following:</p>
    <p>
    For the fastest start with db4o please work through the tutorial, available in different
    formats in the following folder:
        <br />
        /usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/tutorial/
        <br />
        The
    HTML tutorial will get you the best overview:
        <br />
        /usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/tutorial/index.html
        <br />
    The PDF tutorial will work best for fulltext search:
        <br />
        /usr/share/doc/packages/db4o/tutorial/db4o-X.x-tutorial.pdf
        <br />
        The db4o engine is one single .dll library for Mono. You should find it here:
        <br />
        /usr/lib/db4o/db4o.dll
        <br />
        In this folder you will also find the complete db4o regression tests. It is recommended to run them on your machine, to help detect possible problems with your Mono installation:
        <br />
        cd /usr/lib/db4o
        <br />
        mono db4o-mono-test.exe</p>
    <br />
