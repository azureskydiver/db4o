.0 db4o Replication ..
In order to use replication, the following configuration settings have ._
to be called before a database file is created or opened:
.c Db4o.Configure().GenerateUUIDs(int.MaxValue);
Db4o.Configure().GenerateVersionNumbers(int.MaxValue); ..
UUIDs are object IDs that are unique across all databases created with ._
db4o. That is achieved by having the database's creation timestamp as part ._
of its objects' UUIDs. The db4o UUID contains two parts. The first part, contains an object ID. The second part identifies the ._
database that originally created this ID. 

The replication system will use this version number to invisibly tell when an object was last replicated, ._
and if any changes have been made to the object since it was last replicated. An object's version number ._
indicates the last time an object was modified. It is the database version at the moment of the modification. 

.1 Simple Replication ..
Now suppose we have opened two ObjectContainers from two different databases called ._
"handheld" and "desktop", that we want to replicate. This is how we do it:
.c ObjectContainer handheld = db4o.OpenFile("handheld.yap");
ObjectContainer desktop = db4o.OpenFile("desktop.yap");

ReplicationSession replication = Replication.Begin(handheld, desktop);

ObjectSet changed = replication.ProviderA().ObjectsChangedSinceLastReplication();

while (changed.HasNext()) 
	replication.Replicate(changed.Next()); 

replication.Commit(); 
handheld.Close();
desktop.Close(); ..
We start by opening two ObjectContainers. The next line, creates the ReplicationSession. This object ._
contains all of the replication-related logic.

After creating the session, there is an interesting line:
.c ObjectSet changed = replication.ProviderA().ObjectsChangedSinceLastReplication(); ..
This line of code will get the provider associated with the first of our sources (the handheld ._
ObjectContainer in this case). Then it finds all of the objects that have been updated or created. ._
The new/modified objects will be returned in an enumerable ObjectSet.

After that comes a simple loop where the resulting objects are replicated one at a time.

The replication.Commit() call at the end is important. This line will save all of the changes we 
have made, and end any needed transactions. Forgetting to make this call will result in ._
your replication changes being discarded when your application ends, or your ObjectContainers are ._
closed.

The #Commit() calls also mark all objects as replicated. Therefore, changed/new objects that are not ._
replicated in this session will be be marked as replicated.      

.a ReplicatingExisting ..
.1 Replicating Existing Data Files ..

As we learned in the previous section, Db4o.Configure().GenerateUUIDs() and ._
Db4o.Configure().GenerateVersionNumbers()  (or its ObjectClass counterparts) ._
must be called before storing any objects to a data file because db4o replication needs ._
object versions and UUIDs to work. This implies that objects in existing data files ._
stored without the correct settings can't be replicated.

Fortunately enabling replication for existing data files is a very simple process: 
We just need to use the Defragment tool in com.db4o.tools (source code only) after ._
enabling replication:

.c Db4o.Configure().ObjectClass(typeof(Task)).EnableReplication(true);
 new Defragment().Run(CurrentFileName(), true); ..
			
After a successful defragmentation our data files are ready for replication.
