Getting Started
=====================================================
In order to work with the ObjectManager you will need:
- a Sun Java Virtual Machine 1.5 or later installed on your machine;
- the directory containing the java binary listed in your PATH environmental
variable (this should be set when you've first installed the 
Java Runtime Environment). 
You can download the latest Java Runtime Environment at: 
http://java.com/getjava


To start ObjectManager 
from UI: double-click the objectmanager.jar
from command-line: execute "java -jar objectmanager.jar"
You can also use objectmanager.bat(Windows) or objectmanager.sh (Linux) 
if you have problems with the above-mentioned methods.
