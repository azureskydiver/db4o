TODO:

- Cleanup current design: fix problems detailed below.

- Rewrite tree code using clear MVC design using JFace.

- Write detail pane.

- Follow up using the bottom-up strategy getting db4o into Red Hat.


*** Follow up with Karen Bennett of Red Hat regarding getting db4o into Red Hat and getting
    GCJ support into Eclipse.

*** Extending VEP article

*** Get XSWT approved for inclusion in VE under the CPL

*** Work with Sybase, BEA, and Actuate on DB API (after browser spike)

*** Start to work on getting new data binding code into Eclipse/JFace

*** VE code jamming session if community wants it.

*** Follow up about getting into OSCon (*done*)

*** XSWT interview (*done*)


After first browser spike done; look at BIRT API; make suggestions for oo improvements.

---------------------

Standardization discussion:

here is the result of our discussion yesterday as I
remember it:


(1) How will our standard look like?

- We don't want to go JDO.
- S.O.D.A. is not intuitive enough.
- Even if we follow the new "Java method safe query"
approach, we will need to build some kind of tree.
- Let's use a new API and make it look as much like
SQL as we can.


(2) Our browser

The majority of the work for our browser will be to
get the GUI right. This is largely independant of
the way our querying API will look. We can port this
S.O.D.A. to our new dialect in no time (2 days).


(3) How do we fit in with other standards?

We don't.
EJB 3.0 is too slow.
JDO 2.0 is too ugly.


(4) Eclipse vs. JCP standardisation bodies.

Eclipse is faster. You just go and do it. 
That's what we will do.

Problems with current design:

- The Model strictly represents an open database file.  It does not represent search results.

- Opening a new database file results in closing and opening the Model object.  It should
  rather tell the Model to open a new database file and then the Model should trigger a refresh
  to all listening views.
  
- The current View object mix in Controller functionality.  Controllers should be separate objects.

- There should be separate Controller objects for each part of the window:
    * Tree
    * Path string
    * Hyperlink area
    * Object field pane
    
- The Model object currently just wraps an ObjectContainer and adds convenience methods.

- The FieldNode hierarchy represents the Model, but also embeds navigation into it!!!

- Navigating/Visiting aspects of the Model should be separated out of the Model graph using the Iterator
  pattern.  The Iterator should be a hierarchy/graph Iterator, and should embed a stack, the 
  visual representation of which will be the path string in the detail pane.
  
- This stack will be how we traverse up the tree control from its root to keep its focus
  synchronized with the detail pane.
  
- This Visitor becomes like the INavigator framework in Essential Data.

- This is how we provide an ED-like provider framework for JFace TreeViewers.


----------------------

Be able to see how many subobjects per node
Break down lists into 1..50, 51-100, etc...
Click on a Java class in package explorer, see instances


Display properties:
  Be able to configure the following on a global or a package basis:
    (select packages by substring or regex)

Display nodes: in addition to toString():
getDeclaredType(), getConcreteType(), getImplementedType(), 
call a specific method, use a special field;

*.*      [declared] [concrete] [method:(name)] [field:(name)]
*.db4o   [concrete] [method:(name)] [field:(name)]
         [declared] [concrete] [method:(name)] [field:(name)]
         [declared] [concrete] [method:(name)] [field:(name)]
         [declared] [concrete] [method:(name)] [field:(name)]


Filter from search box; limit search depth (add UI for this)
 - Incremental search
 - Regular expression


- Hide package names option
- Hide these classes option (for hiding system classes)


*DONE* Put SWT application launching instructions in /dev


April: version 1.0
October timeframe: mature browser



Carl's notes:

  Popup Nodes, if there are too many. Display first 50 and use node to expand
  Would like to see the number items per class
  Double-clicking on a node: Browse from here.
  History for objects
  Update the browse view from selecting class in Java perspective
  Declared type and implemented type
  Hide package names

  [declared type] [concrete type] [method:toString] [method:(name)] [field:(name)]


Use-cases:

1) Run on mobile devices

2) Debug use-cases:

2.1) Navigate
2.2) Query
2.3) Visualize object graphs  (Java Spider)
