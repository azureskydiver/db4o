General design ideas:

   * Query view/editor
      * By default, shows classes in current file.
      * Can generate more complex QBE queries than that.

   * Database browser can run either as a view or as an editor
      * If as a view, it tracks the current selection.  
         * If the current selection is a Java class, it displays all instances of it
      * Browser as editor is opened in response to QBE queries.
      
   * Multiple types of database browsers:
      * List/Detail form based
      * Spider-like
         * Each node could be a list/detail browser; drag field from detail view to browse subobjects
         * Use GEF
         
   * Have a db4o project nature that records the name of the db4o database.
      * The database view will automatically open the database when classes in that project are open.
      

Implementation ideas:

   * Use Resources framework
      * Including the selection service
      * Make the database browser view
