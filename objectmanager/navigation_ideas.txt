Issues with the UI:

- Navigating the object graph: What string to call an object?
- Perhaps just use the object class plus the db4object ID?
- Configureable?  Choose what attribute to show?

- For collections (within the tree): Show the first x elements, then
  an elipsis


- Two UI ideas:

- Tree-based navigator with list/detail pane
- Something like Java Spider
