(N1) .NET class "Cs.cs"
-----------------------
Querying on the Cs class runs into a NullPointerException

Notes: This is happening in the middle of the generic reflector code; I suggest
looking there.


(N2) ObjectTree.yap
---------------------
Opening any of the UUIDTest.Device classes shows a problem
with .NET databases:
They do not work with UUID fields yet.
